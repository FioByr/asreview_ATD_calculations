# The influence of active learning model and prior knowledge choice on how long it takes to find hard-to-find papers: Examining the variability of the time-to-discovery and the stability of its’ rank-orders

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to explore how the choice of active learning (AL) model and prior knowledge influences the time-to-discovery (TD) of the hard-to-find papers in a dataset while using an AL-aided screening tool in the context of systematic reviewing (e.g., ASReview)

This repository contains the files to reproduce the simulation study and the subsequent analysis of the data for this project (which was conducted for a Master's thesis in Applied Data Science from Utrecht University). 

## Table of Contents

### data

This folder contains the dataset (Radjenović et al., 2013) that was used in the simulation studies. 

### output

This folder contains the the TD tables and the rank-order of the TD tables outputted from the multiple models and ARFI templates that were used to analyse. As well, the figures that were generated from the analysis are included.

### scripts

This folder contains the scripts that were modified/generated to extract the TD and the rank-orders of the TD tables through ASReview's Makita workflow generator. 

### simulation_folders 

This folder contains the scripts and folders/files that were generated through ASReview's Makita workflow generator to conduct the simulation study. The scripts (as a jobs.bat file) to reproduce the multiple models and ARFI simulation are contained.
