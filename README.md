# The influence of active learning model and prior knowledge choice on how long it takes to find hard-to-find papers: Examining the variability of the time-to-discovery and the stability of itsâ€™ rank-orders

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to explore how the choice of active learning (AL) model and prior knowledge influences the time-to-discovery of the hard-to-find papers in a dataset while using an AL-aided screening tool in the context of systematic reviewing (e.g., ASReview)

This repository contains the files to reproduce the simulation study and the subsequent analysis of the data for this project (which was conducted for a Master's thesis in Applied Data Science from Utrecht University).
