## How to access data?

### Synergy Dataset
The data used in the current project was the Radjenovic dataset (RadjenoviÄ‡ et al., 2013) which was taken from the SYNERGY dataset (De Bruin et al., 2023). The SYNERGY dataset can be donwloaded by first installing the synergy-dataset Python package.

````python
pip intall synergy-dataset
````

Then run this command in the command line.

````python
python -m synergy_dataset get 
````

Alternatively, .zip of the dataset can be downloaded at https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/HE6NAQ

## How to pre-process the data?

### Deduplication
There were 14 duplicate records removed from the the Radjenovic dataset, and one record which had a missing abstract. Duplications were removed using a command from the asreview-datatools, which can be installed via this command. 

````python
pip install asreview-datatools
````

Deduplication can be then completed by running this command.

````python
asreview data dedup Radjenovic_2013.csv -o Radjenovic_2013_ndup.csv
````

### data_preprocessing.py

To remove the missing abstracts run the script data_preprocessing.py. One record with a missing abstract is removed. The new dataset Radjenovic_2013_ndup_nnan.csv is saved within the data files within each of the simulation project folders (multiple_models_simulation and arfi_simulation).
