To maximize survival and reproduction in their local environment, hosts should resist their local parasites and pathogens. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with its key function in parasite resistance represents an ideal candidate to investigate parasite-mediated local adaptation. Using replicated field mesocosms, stocked with second-generation lab-bred three-spined stickleback hybrids of a lake and a river population, we show local adaptation of MHC genotypes to population-specific parasites, independently of the genetic background. Increased allele divergence of lake MHC genotypes allows lake fish to fight the broad range of lake parasites, whereas more specific river genotypes confer selective advantages against the less diverse river parasites. Hybrids with local MHC genotype gained more body weight and thus higher fitness than those with foreign MHC in either habitat, suggesting the evolutionary significance of locally adapted MHC genotypes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/45/12/301,Objective comparison of image quality and dose between conventional and synchrotron radiation mammography,"The shape of the energy spectrum produced by an x-ray tube has a great importance in mammography. Many anode-filtration combinations have been proposed to obtain the most effective spectrum shape for the image quality-dose relationship. On the other hand, third generation synchrotrons such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble are able to produce a high flux of monoenergetic radiation. It is thus a powerful tool to study the effect of beam energy on image quality and dose in mammography. An objective method was used to evaluate image quality and dose in mammography with synchrotron radiation and to compare them to standard conventional units. It was performed systematically in the energy range of interest for mammography through the evaluation of a global image quality index and through the measurement of the mean glandular dose. Compared to conventional mammography units, synchrotron radiation shows a great improvement of the image quality-dose relationship, which is due to the beam monochromaticity and to the high intrinsic collimation of the beam, which allows the use of a slit instead of an anti-scatter grid for scatter rejection.",0
,[Genetic linkage of the autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth amyotrophy and 3 genetic markers on chromosome 1].,"In a large pedigree with the autosomal dominant form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type I (CMT 1) segregating in four generations, genetic linkage was studied between this disease and three genetic markers from the centromere region of chromosome 1: Duffy blood group (Fy), salivary and pancreatic isoamylases (AMY 1, AMY 2), and DNA polymorphism at the antithrombin III locus, detected with the probe pAT3c. The lod-scores found do not support linkage between CMT 1 and both Fy and AT 3, since they are negative for all recombination frequencies. Very close linkage could have been excluded. For the AMY polymorphism, the pedigree was not linkage-informative. In agreement with the data from literature, these results support the notion of genetic heterogeneity of CMT 1: in the pedigree under study, the responsible locus is probably not in the centromeric region of the chromosome 1, where it was shown to map to in several other pedigrees. Thus, there seem to exist at least two loci responsible for this type of CMT disease.",0

In these studies the photodynamic activities of the zinc, copper and metal-free BI derivatives were compared in vivo in C3H-HeJ mice bearing a mammary adenocarcinoma tumor line. In vitro studies were also performed with the radiation-induced fibrosarcoma tumor line. An argon-pumped Ti-sapphire laser tuned to deliver light between 710 and 800 nm or an Oriel arc-lamp filtered to deliver broadband light above 590 nm were used as light source. A lipid emulsion was used as the delivery system for sensitizers in all studies. A pronounced solvent dependence was observed for the Q band for each of all iminium salts examined. As an example, the metal-free (BI) derivative had an absorption maximum at 798 nm in dichloromethane and at 727 nm in serum. The action spectra showed a greater PDT response at blue-shifted wavelengths for each of the three iminium salts both in vivo and in vitro. Among the three derivatives, the zinc analog (ZnBI) produced the greatest tumor regression at the low drug/light dose of 0.7 (μ mole/kg and 200 J/cm2. These results indicate that iminium salts have characteristics that may make them promising third-generation photosensitizers.",0

While modern plasma-derived FVIII concentrates have an excellent safety profile, there is an inexorable shift towards the use of recombinant products, especially in affluent countries. Recombinant FVIII products have demonstrated excellent haemostatic efficacy and higher safety with regard to the transmission of blood-borne pathogens. The experience in haemophilia A treatment with five currently available recombinant FVIII products, including the first third-generation product, Advate, which is completely free from human or animal proteins, is summarised. Some unresolved problems concerning the efficacy and assaying of recombinant factors and future perspectives of both recombinant and plasma-derived FVIII products in global haemophilia care, are also discussed.",0

A clinical study of a large family with a novel thyroid hormone receptor mutation,"Thyroid hormone resistance (RTH) is characterised by variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone. The disorder is usually caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta). We describe a large family with this disorder. SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENT: We identified 36 family members with RTH in four generations by screening relatives of patients with the diagnosis. The diagnosis was verified by identification of a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Symptoms, clinical findings and laboratory tests of 29 affected individuals were compared with those of 16 first-degree relatives.Bone maturation in children with RTH was delayed. The height was lower both in children and in adults with RTH than in the controls. Children with RTH had lower birth weight than the controls, particularly when the condition was inherited from the father. We did not observe increased prevalence of neuropsychological symptoms associated with RTH in this family. Palpitations and increased pulse rate indicated mild cardiac hyperthyroidism. Direct sequence analysis of the TR beta gene revealed a novel point mutation, a heterozygous transition c.1031G>C in exon 9 theoretically substituting Gly344Ala.We found evidence of skeletal tissue hypothyroidism that resulted in permanent growth retardation from prenatal to adult life. We found substantial variations in thyroid hormone levels and clinical presentation, but most individuals were without symptoms of thyroid disorder.",0
,Hepatitis C virus seroprevalence in patients attending a sexual health centre.,"To determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients attending the Christchurch sexual health centre.Anonymised unlinked serum specimens from 362 patients sequentially attending the sexual health centre were obtained and tested for HCV antibody using the second generation enzyme immunoassay kit (Abbott). Antibody positive samples were assayed for virus by amplification of hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA).Twelve patients (3.3%) were seropositive and 10 samples were also positive for virus RNA (2.7%). In 50% of cases the patients had no discernible risk factors other than unprotected sexual intercourse. An overall serum prevalence of 22% (4/19) was noted within a sub population who admitted to intravenous drug use. Ninety patients had, at the time of consultation, requested an antibody test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There were no antibodies to HIV detected in any of these patients nor any statistical difference in HCV antibody prevalence within this group.Hepatitis C is a common viral infection within the community. A significant percentage of patients who were anti HCV positive had no discernible risk factors other than sexual transmission which must be considered as a mode of transmission. We concur with the Department of Health guidelines emphasising the need for safer sex practices in a patient with a diagnosis of hepatitis C.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/es3036785,Toxicity of Quantum Dots and Cadmium Salt to Caenorhabditis elegans after Multigenerational Exposure,"To fully understand the biological and environmental impacts of nanomaterials requires studies that address both sublethal end points and multigenerational effects. Here, we use a nematode to examine these issues as they relate to exposure to two different types of quantum dots, core (CdSe) and core-shell (CdSe/ZnS), and to compare the effect to those observed after cadmium salt exposures. The strong fluorescence of the core-shell QDs allowed for the direct visualization of the materials in the digestive track within a few hours of exposure. Multiple end points, including both developmental and locomotive, were examined at QD exposures of low (10 mg/L Cd), medium (50 mg/L Cd), and high concentrations (100 mg/L Cd). While the core-shell QDs showed no effect on fitness (lifespan, fertility, growth, and three parameters of motility behavior), the core QDs caused acute effects similar to those found for cadmium salts, suggesting that biological effects may be attributed to cadmium leaching from the more soluble QDs. Over multiple generations, we commonly found that for lower life-cycle exposures to core QDs the parents response was generally a poor predictor of the effects on progeny. At the highest concentrations, however, biological effects found for the first generation were commonly similar in magnitude to those found in future generations.",1

The comparison between silver(I) and gold(I) catalysts in this reaction was established by working with chiral phosphoramidites or with chiral BINAP. The best reaction conditions were used for the total synthesis of the hepatitis C virus inhibitor by a four step procedure affording this product in 99% ee and in 63% overall yield. The origin of the enantioselectivity of the chiral gold(I) catalyst was justified according to DFT calculations, the stabilizing coulombic interaction between the nitrogen atom of the thiazole moiety and one of the gold atoms being crucial.",0

When female rats, which have been treated neonatally, are subsequently mated to normal males, their offspring show unexpected gonadal and thyroidal defects, such as reduced weaning weight and delayed vaginal opening and first estrus in females; males show a significant increase in relative thyroid weight and a significant decrease in ventral prostate weight. Cross-fostering was done to separate prenatal from postnatal influences. Even more surprising was the finding that when the untreated female F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; progeny were mated with normal males, the untreated F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; progeny showed more defects and to a greater degree than those present in the maternal parent.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s003910050139,Occurrence of chronic diseases and their impact on physical disability over the whole spectrum of aging: from 65 to over 100 years of age,"The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority. In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old. To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs. Preliminary results from the PRO.V.A study show that disability is associated with conditions that are potentially preventable as chronic diseases and falls or are treatable as chronic pains. Moreover, it is of extreme interest to identify and understand biological and environmental secrets of successful aging as the AKEA study tries to do and the ways of overcoming disabilities in the extreme limits of life more and more possible to reach.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.880080405,Familial neuromuscular disease with tubular aggregates,We have studied four members of a family in which five individuals of both sexes in three generations have mild weakness and muscle aching. Serum creatine kinase (CK) and/or aldolase were mildly to moderately elevated. Tubular aggregates were present in all patients in all fiber types. Type 1 fiber predominance and type 2 hypotrophy or atrophy was noted in three biopsies. Fiber splitting was prominent in two cases. Electron microscopic studies confirm that the tubular aggregates originate from muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The presence of T tubules making contacts with some tubules inside the collection of tubular aggregates is suggestive of their derivation from terminal cisternae.,0

Her father and grandfather were similarly affected. The reticular hyperpigmentation, although generalized, was more intense on the flexural areas where extensive milia formation was also observed. This case represents an unusual genodermatosis. The milia formation and the presence of normal perspiration indicate a special form of Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn (NFJ) syndrome, or a new entity close to the NFJ syndrome. The differential diagnosis from other congenital reticulate pigmentary disorders is discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0048-9697(96)05413-7,Levels of chromosomal damage in hepatocytes of wild rats living within the area of a waste disposal plant,"Genetic damage induced by ionizing radiation or chemical mutagens/carcinogens has been shown to persist over periods of months in rat hepatocytes, implying that continual exposure to low levels of mutagens will cause an accumulation of damage. Thus, it was assumed that hepatocytes of wild rats could be useful as ‘biological indicators’ for the exposure to mutagens/carcinogens in the environment. To test for this hypothesis house rats ( Rattus rattus ) were trapped at a waste disposal site and the levels of micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations determined. The results indicate that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations increases with the weight (age) of the animals, while micronuclei did not significantly differ from the level found in laboratory rats. For comparison Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) trapped at the same site were analyzed for the same cytogenetic endpoints. We note a less pronounced weight dependent increase of chromosomal aberrations, most probably reflecting the different residence time at the waste disposal plant, an age dependent decrease of chromosomal aberrations of the F1-generation housed in the animal facility, indicating that the offspring had been exposed transplacentally and an age independent level of chromosomal aberrations in the F2-generation not significantly different from that of the Fischer 344 laboratory rat.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03404049,"Immigration, Generation and Self-rated Health in Canada: On the Role of Health Literacy","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in self-rated health by immigration and generational status, and the role of health literacy in this relationship. Methods: Data were from the Canadian component of the 2003 International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey (IALSS) undertaken by Statistics Canada. The sample comprised a total of 22,818 persons, of whom 3,861 were immigrants and 18,957 non-immigrants. The study employed logistic regression to examine the relationship between health literacy and self-rated health. The analysis separately compared: immigrants and non-immigrants; immigrant groups defined by region of origin and recency of arrival in Canada; and the local-born defined by generation. Results: Logistic regression results indicated that immigrants compared to non-immigrants, and recent immigrants not from Europe or USA compared to established immigrants from Europe or USA, were more likely to report good self-rated health. On the other hand, compared to the third-plus generation, the second generation were less likely to report good self-rated health. Health literacy was positively associated with good self-rated health. However, its effect was largely accounted for by discordance between mother tongue and language of survey administration among immigrants, and by literacy practices at home, education, place of residence, and income among non-immigrants. Conclusion: Health literacy is important in the health of both immigrants and non-immigrants, but with different underlying mechanisms. For non-immigrants, engaging in literacy practices at home would benefit both health literacy and overall health, whereas for immigrants, it would be improving proficiency in either English or French. Key words: Health literacy; health status; immigrants; generations",1
https://doi.org/10.1079/phn2001148,"A review of ethnicity, health and nutrition-related diseases in relation to migration in the United Kingdom","Abstract Objectives: To identify lessons from and gaps in research on diet-disease links among former migrants in the United Kingdom (UK). Results: Migrant status and self-identified ethnicity do not match so these terms mask differences in social, nutritional and health status within and between population groups. Some former migrants differ in causes of death from the general population, e.g.: fewer coronary heart disease deaths among Caribbean-born; fewer cancer deaths among Caribbean, South Asian- and East African-born adults. Irish- and Scottish-born have higher mortality from all causes. Experience of risk factors differ also, e.g.: higher prevalences of hypertension and diabetes in Caribbean- and South Asian-born adults than representative samples of the general population; obesity and raised waist-hip circumference ratios in South Asian, African-Caribbean and some Irish-born adults. Former migrants experience long-term disadvantage, associated with more self-defined illness and lower reported physical activity. Nutrient intake data from the few, recent, small-scale studies must be interpreted with caution due to methodological diversity. However, second generation offspring of former migrants appear to adopt British dietary patterns, increasing fat and reducing vegetable, fruit and pulse consumption compared with first generation migrants. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence on why some former migrants but not others experience lower specific mortality than the general population. Dietary intake variations provide important clues particularly when examined by age and migration status. Majority ethnic and younger migrant groups could raise and sustain high fruit and vegetable intakes but lower proportions of fat, by adopting many dietary practices from older migrants. Objective measures of physical activity and longitudinal studies of diets among different ethnic groups are needed to explain diversity in health outcomes and provide for evidence-based action.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/154407370301700104,Dental Informatics: A Work in Progress,"Dental informatics is a young scientific discipline that is undergoing continual maturation. Its literature is estimated to consist of approximately 600 papers published between 1975 and 2003, and it is currently growing at a rate of about 50 papers annually. While interest in the discipline is growing, the number of core contributors to dental informatics research remains relatively small. Two major questions for the discipline are: What are the research challenges that dental informatics faces today? and How can the discipline be strengthened and positioned to maximize its success in addressing those challenges? Progress toward research challenges formulated more than ten years ago has been varied. While many new technologies have become available for clinical dental practice, research, and education, many fundamental problems remain to be addressed with informatics research. Recommendations to augment the research capacity in dental informatics include creating a stronger worldwide dental informatics research community, drawing more biomedical informatics researchers to dental research areas, providing career opportunities for dental informatics researchers, addressing grand challenges together as a community, and recruiting subsequent generations of dental informaticians.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpag.2006.01.001,Intergenerational Transfer of Douching Information,"To characterize the discussions on douching that female parents/guardians have with daughters.A questionnaire assessing personal douching history, beliefs on the practice of douching, and what they had discussed or intended to discuss about douching with their daughters was administered to women who were parenting females 11-21 years of age.Fifty-seven women who had douched or currently douche completed the questionnaire.Fifty-six of the women had discussed or planned to discuss the subject with their daughters. The girls with whom they had had a discussion were significantly older (16.2 years) than those with whom they planned to have a discussion (14.1 years). Most (73%) of the women had encouraged or planned to encourage douching, while only 18% had or planned to discourage it. Mothers had or planned to have the conversation in the context of menses (76%), sexual activity (40%), or when their daughter instigated the conversation (44%). Over 40% of the mothers had not or did not intend to discuss any negatives about douching. Only ten of the women stated that a health care provider had spoken to them or their daughter about the subject.Female parents/guardians are an important source of information about douching for their daughters. Health care providers need to educate girls as well as the women who parent them on the health risks associated with douching. Public campaigns aimed at decreasing douching should target this intergenerational transfer of information.",0
,Do antipsychotic drugs influence suicidal behavior in schizophrenia?,"The literature concerning the net effect of antipsychotic medication on suicidality in patients with schizophrenia is not consistent. This review assesses this problem in the light of relevant research. MEDLINE was used to search for articles written in English from 1964 to 2006. Articles were classified according to the following three orientations: positive, negative, or null effect on suicidality. Several inconsistencies among the studies and methodological difficulties appeared and a singular conclusion on this issue was not possible. Competing properties of various antipsychotic drugs may have differential effects on suicidality. Second-generation antipsychotic agents appear to have a better potential for preventing suicide in schizophrenia, but the relative profile of each drug is yet to be clarified. A good profile to treat hostility, impulsivity, and depression while not provoking extrapyramidal side effects is crucial when choosing an antipsychotic in the presence of suicide risk. The strongest and perhaps unique evidence has been shown for clozapine, which seems to have a clinically relevant advantage over both first- and second-generation antipsychotics for reducing suicidality. Although clozapine has not yet demonstrated a specific preventing effect on completed suicide in patients with schizophrenia, it should be considered when suicide risk is detected in a patient with schizophrenia.",0

This phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity of axitinib combined with chemotherapy.A total of 42 patients with advanced solid tumours received a continuous axitinib starting dose of 5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) plus paclitaxel (90 mg m(-2) weekly), docetaxel (100 mg m(-2) every 3 weeks) or capecitabine (1000 or 1250 mg m(-2) b.i.d., days 1-14).Common treatment-related adverse events across all cohorts were nausea (45.2%), hypertension (45.2%), fatigue (42.9%), diarrhoea (38.1%), decreased appetite (33.3%) and hand-foot syndrome (31.0%). There was one complete response, nine partial responses and seven patients with stable disease. Ten patients (23.8%) remained on therapy for >8 months.

Antitumour activity was observed for each treatment regimen and across multiple tumour types.",0
,"[Uncomplicated gonorrhea and disseminated gonococcal infections--clinical aspects, diagnosis and therapy].",Gonorrhoea is not only the oldest but also still one of the most frequent sexually transmitted diseases. Under therapeutic aspects it seems worthwhile to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated forms. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea - urethritis being its most important variant - can be cured by adequate single injection treatment while complicated disease cannot. Disseminated infection is one of the major threats of gonococcal infection. The outcome is potentially fatal. Therapeutic considerations today have to take antibiotic-resistant or even multi-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeaestrains into account. Third-generation cephalosporins and second-generation quinolones represent potential alternatives to conventional agents.,0
https://doi.org/10.1097/nxn.0b013e318266cbc5,A Transition to E-Mentoring,"E-mentoring is a form of mentoring that uses the Internet to remove the boundaries of traditional mentoring. Instead of face-to-face and synchronous communication, interactions between mentor(s) and protégé(s) of e-mentoring relationships are primarily asynchronous. Since there was limited information about nurses and e-mentoring in the literature, this quantitative study was undertaken to explore nurses' attitudes and the identification of facilitators and constraints that could influence the adoption of e-mentoring. Overall, participants (n = 139) had positive attitudes; there were differences in attitudes between participants who had previously experienced mentoring and those who never had (P < .05). The likely-to-engage group had more positive attitudes and identified more facilitators and fewer constraints than did the indecisive and not-likely groups (P < .001). Age and attitudes had a positive relationship with e-mentoring (P = .01). These findings suggest that e-mentoring can be adopted by nurses of all ages, and despite the constraints identified, the benefits of e-mentoring may outweigh the constraints. Organizations considering the adoption of e-mentoring should encourage nurses with positive attitudes and previous mentoring experience to participate in their endeavors. E-mentoring can address today's multigenerational nursing workforce and positively influence the mentoring process.",0

The parent generation (F 0 ) and the F 1 generation were each bred once. Parameters examined included indices of fertility, gestation of dams, gestation survival, 0- to 4-, 4- to 14- and 4- to 21-day survival of pups, number of pups born alive, and number of pups weaned per litter. Furthermore, observations were made on mortality, diet consumption, and body weight of the adult rats in F 0 and F 1 generation. Randomly selected F 1 weanlings and adults and F 2 weanlings were sacrificed and organ weights were obtained; in addition, gross and histologic examinations were conducted on these rats. No reproductive toxicity was observed in this study. Some effects were observed in both sexes for the F 0 and F 1 parent rats. These effects were mainly associated with the high dosage level and included reduction of body weight gain and changes in liver (decrease) and kidney (increase) weights in the adult rats. The only microscopic lesion observed was hepatocellular pleomorphism in the high level F 1 adult males and females; a greater prevalence and severity of this lesion was seen in the female rats.",1

The anomalies were transmitted to the second generation (F2). The present results concern the third generation. Two experimental groups have been studied: a hybrid group, resulting from crosses between control subjects and either experimental F2 males or females, and a nonhybrid group, obtained by mating experimental F2 subjects together. Significant abnormalities were found in all experimental groups, whether the F2 subjects were male or female. F2 females had smaller litters whether they were mated with control or experimental males. Body weight was significantly increased in both hybrid and nonhybrid males. Increased postnatal mortality and learning deficit were also observed in the hybrid group. Such complex phenotypic changes confirm that frequent mutations probably have been inherited from the treated males but also suggest that genetic rearrangements have occurred from one generation to the next.",1

Young people treated with antipsychotic medication are particularly at risk as they experience significant weight gain as a side effect of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) with consequent increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic syndrome. However, surveillance for these side effects is not carried out nor intervention offered in routine clinical prctice. This paper examines the current state of evidence on this topic and suggests directions for future research and clinical practice. Conclusions: Systematic monitoring and preventative programs aimed at weight gain and metabolic side effects should form an integral part of the comprehensive management of adolescents on SGAs.",0

It is administered orally once daily and is approved in the US, Canada, Mexico, Israel and the EU for use as monotherapy and as adjunct therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Results of well designed clinical studies indicate that rasagiline is effective as initial monotherapy and improves Parkinson's symptomatology in patients with early Parkinson's disease. In addition, when administered in conjunction with levodopa, in patients with moderate to advanced disease and motor fluctuations, rasagiline reduces mean daily 'off' time and increases daily 'on' time without troublesome dyskinesias, compared with controls. Rasagiline is generally well tolerated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy and is administered once daily. Thus, rasagiline, administered as a simple and convenient dosage regimen, is a well tolerated and effective option for monotherapy in patients with early Parkinson's disease and for adjunctive therapy in patients with moderate to advanced disease.",0

Most patients with NPH occur sporadically: until now, only two families have been reported to have sibling cases of NPH. We here report a large family with 4 patients with elderly-onset NPH in three generations. All of them had cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, and urinary problems, along with normal pressure of cerebrospinal fluid. Their brain MRI showed enlargement of the ventricles and a disproportional narrowing of the subarachnoid space and cortical sulci at the high convexity of the cerebrum, which are the features of iNPH on MRI. The family interview also disclosed additional 4 patients who were suspected as having NPH. The disease seems to be inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. No known causes of secondary NPH were found in any of the patients. This is the first report to show a large family with NPH patients in three generations, who had clinical and MRI features indistinguishable from iNPH. This seems to represent a novel subgroup of NPH, familial NPH.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-139x.2006.00118.x,Dialyzer Reuse-Part I: Historical Perspective,"The first apparatus for hemodialysis in animals, made painstakingly by Abel et al. in their laboratory at the beginning of 20th century, was cleaned with acid-pepsin to digest blood, disinfected with thymol, and reused for up to 30 experiments for as long as 8 months. The obvious incentive was saving time. In the early years of hemodialysis in patients, dialyzers and lines were assembled and sterilized immediately before dialysis. Various methods of dry and moist heat sterilization and miscellaneous chemical agents were employed for disinfection. Significant time was required to assemble the dialyzers, so there was an incentive to reuse previously assembled dialyzers to save time, especially for home hemodialysis. Bleach to clean and formaldehyde to disinfect the membranes and lines was used for this purpose. Preassembled dialyzers, commercially introduced in the 1950s, were the most expensive components of hemodialysis systems, therefore reprocessing of these dialyzers was the most effective way to save money. Refrigeration of coil dialyzers with blood, introduced in the mid-1960s, was associated with frequent febrile reactions and was soon abandoned. Preassembled coil and plate dialyzers permitted almost complete return of blood after dialysis and led to the introduction of chemical disinfection for dialyzer reprocessing. A variety of disinfectants have been used. Formaldehyde was the most common disinfectant until the end of the 1970s. Sodium hypochlorite was used to clean the majority of dialyzers and to sterilize dialyzers with polyacrylonitrile membranes. In the early 1980s, peracetic acid and glutaraldehyde started to compete with formaldehyde. By the 1990s, formaldehyde had become less popular than peracetic acid. In the mid-1990s, disinfection and membrane cleaning with acetic acid and heat was introduced. Manual reprocessing was replaced by early reuse machines in the mid-1970s and a more sophisticated second generation of automated hemodialyzer reprocessing machines followed in the late 1970s. Recently disinfection of dialyzers with moist heat has resumed. Saving both time for the patient and money for the provider were the main motivations for designing a new machine for daily home hemodialysis. The machine, developed in the 1990s, cleans and moist-heat disinfects the dialyzer and lines in situ so they do not need to be changed for a month. In contrast, the reuse of dialyzers in home hemodialysis patients treated with other hemodialysis machines has become less popular and is almost extinct.",0

The brother married a normal woman, and they have 2 daughters; one of them has typical changes of pseudoachondroplasia, the other is normal. The most likely explanation in this family is gonadal (germinal cell) mosaicism in one of the grandparents. Other reports of possible autosomal recessive pseudoachondroplasia are reviewed. It is likely that gonadal mosaicism is responsible for a small percentage of cases with what appears to be a new mutation for pseudoachondroplasia.",0

The lineage has unveiled abnormalities over four generations affecting 21 people with congenital bilateral cataract, with or without cleft palate. The transmission seems autosomal dominant. Four brothers and sisters presented with this defect, and a fifth sister is healthy. The mother has facial dimorphism, congenital bilateral cataract, submucous cleft palate, clinodactyly, and scoliosis. The propositus' karyotype was normal. Array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analysis showed an interstitial amplification in Xp21.1, found in the mother, in all the affected siblings but one, and in the healthy girl. Thisl association is not rare and has been reported in over 50 syndromes but rarely in familial observations. Based on the genetic-clinical discordance we wonder about the deleterious impact of the Xp21.1 amplification that might be a copy number polymorphism.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11302-008-9118-y,Pharmacological evidence for the stimulation of NADPH oxidase by P2X7 receptors in mouse submandibular glands,"ATP in the 100 muM-1 mM concentration range provoked a calcium-independent increase of the oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) to dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by mouse submandibular cells. 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), a P2X(7) agonist, but not a muscarinic or an adrenergic agonist, reproduced the effect of ATP. The inhibition of phospholipase C by U73122 or the potentiation of P2X(4) receptor activation with ivermectin did not modify the response to ATP. ATP did not increase the oxidation of DCFH in cells isolated from submandibular glands of P2X(7) knockout mice or in cells pretreated with a P2X(7) antagonist. The inhibition of protein kinase C or of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) or of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase blocked the oxidation of DCFH without affecting the increase of the intracellular concentration of calcium or the uptake of ethidium bromide in response to extracellular ATP. From these results it is concluded that the activation of the P2X(7) receptors from submandibular glands triggers an intracellular signalling cascade involving protein kinase C and MAP kinase leading to the stimulation of NADPH oxidase and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.08.016,Positive cardiac troponin I and T and chest pain in a patient with iatrogenic hypothyroidism and no coronary artery disease,"<h2>Abstract</h2> We report about a 41-year old male patient who presented to the emergency room with acute chest pain, exertion dyspnoea, muscle stiffness, myalgia and adynamia. There was no history of coronary artery disease but known arterial hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Four weeks before submission the patient had been thyroidectomized after he had been diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma and was now awaiting further radioiodine therapy. The thyroid-stimulating hormone level was markedly elevated to 67 mU/l (normal range 0.27–4.20 mU/l) and fT4 significantly reduced to 0.19 ng/ml (normal range 0.9–1.9 ng/ml). CK was elevated to 328 U/l, cardiac Troponin I (Stratus® CS) above the threshold with 0.13 μg/l and Elecsys® third generation troponin T above the threshold with 0.04 μg/l. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and did not reveal any signs of ST-elevation or -depression. During follow-up a cardiac MRI was performed, showing normal dimensions and function but a very small area of diffuse myocardial damage, atypical of ischemic injury. In coronary angiography normal coronary arteries were found. We conclude that cardiac troponins I and T may be elevated in severe hypothyroidism without coronary artery disease due to diffuse myocardial injury which can be imaged by MRI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2011.09.027,Advanced paternal and grandpaternal age and schizophrenia: A three-generation perspective,"Advanced paternal age has been linked with an increased risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. If age-related de novo mutations in the male germ line underlie this association, grandpaternal and paternal age would both be expected to influence the risk of schizophrenia. The aim of the current study was to explore the links between both paternal and grandpaternal age with respect to the risk of schizophrenia in a large, national register-based cohort.We linked the Swedish Multi-Generation and Hospital Discharge Registers and compared parents' ages at offspring birth for 20,582 schizophrenia-affected and 100,176 non-affected individuals. Grandparents' ages at the birth of the parent were compared between 2511 affected and 15,619 non-affected individuals. The risk of schizophrenia was examined with logistic regression when the predictor variable (parent or grandparent age) varied across age strata.After adjusting for maternal age, birth year and proband sex, we confirmed that offspring of older fathers had an increased risk of schizophrenia. Compared to those with paternal age 20-24years, those with fathers >55years had a two-fold increased risk of schizophrenia. With respect to grandparent age, older maternal (but not paternal) grandfather age was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. Compared to maternal grandfather age 20-24years, those with maternal grandfathers >55years had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals; 2.79, 1.71-4.56). The pattern of results was essentially unchanged when we examined male and female probands separately.This is the first study to report an association between grandpaternal age and risk of schizophrenia. The selective effect of advanced maternal grandfather age suggests that the biological mechanisms involving the X-chromosome may differentially contribute to the association between paternal age and offspring risk of schizophrenia.",0

Multivariable analyses controlled for potentially confounding variables. Tests for effect modification by gender and Mexican origin were conducted.Fewer first generation adolescents transitioned to sexual intercourse before age 18 (odds ratio [OR]=.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.66-.98) and fewer first and second generation sexually active teens used contraceptives consistently at age 17 (OR=.32, 95% CI=.17-.60 and OR=.50, 95% CI=.31-.80, respectively) than third-generation teens. Language was similarly associated with the transition to sexual intercourse and contraceptive practices. Versus teens of Mexican origin, teens of Puerto Rican origin and origins other than Cuba and Central/South America had greater odds of becoming sexually active; youth of all origins except Central/South America had fewer multiple live births (OR=.14-.31). Gender modified the effects of generation on consistent use of contraceptives and condoms at age 17. Gender also modified the effect of country of origin on transitioning to sexual intercourse before age 18 years.Results expand on previous observations that generation, language, and country of origin are predictors of reproductive and sexual risks for Hispanic adolescents. These immigration measures may therefore be useful in targeting community and clinical preventive services.",1

,Human T-lymphotropic virus type I seroprevalence among Japanese Americans.,"The epidemiology of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection is not well defined in Japanese Americans. This impairs using approaches that could reduce viral transmission and monitor carriers for the disease. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and p21e recombinant Western blot testing, HTLV-I antibody was measured in unlinked samples from Japanese-American patients at 4 physicians' offices in San Francisco, California. Of 442 patients, 4 (0.9%; 95% confidence interval 0.25%, 2.3%) were confirmed seropositive, all with an HTLV-I rather than an HTLV-II pattern on Western blot. Seroprevalence was highest among the issei or immigrant generation (3/230 or 1.3%) compared with the second-generation nisei (1/191 or 0.5%) or third-generation sansei (0 of 17). Prevalence did not differ by age or sex, although the number of positive subjects in each subgroup was small. Of 88 patients with familial origins in endemic areas of southern Japan, none were seropositive. In this sample of Japanese Americans, HTLV-I seroprevalence was lower than in residents of endemic southern Japan but higher than among American blood donors. The prevalence was most similar to that in nonendemic areas of Japan. The public health implications of HTLV-I infection among Japanese Americans are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0437941100,"Transgene produces massive overexpression of human β-glucuronidase in mice, lysosomal storage of enzyme, and strain-dependent tumors","beta-Glucuronidase (GUSB) is a lysosomal enzyme important in the normal step-wise degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Deficiency of GUSB causes the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII, Sly disease). Affected patients have widespread progressive accumulation of beta-glucuronide-containing glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes. Enzyme replacement, bone marrow transplantation, and gene therapy can correct lysosomal storage in the MPS VII mouse model. Gene therapy in MPS VII patients and animals may result in massive overexpression of GUSB in individual tissues, and the toxicity of such overexpression is incompletely investigated. To gain insight into the effect of massive overexpression of GUSB, we established 19 transgenic mouse lines, two of which expressed very high levels of human GUSB in many tissues. The founder overexpressing mice had from >100- to several thousand-fold increases in tissue and serum GUSB. The enzyme expression in most tissues decreased in subsequent generations in one line, and expression in liver and marrow fell in subsequent generations of the other. Both lines had morphologically similar widespread lysosomal storage of GUSB and secondary elevations of other lysosomal enzymes, a finding characteristic of lysosomal storage disease. One line developed tumors, and one did not. These transgenic models show that massive overexpression of a lysosomal enzyme can be associated with dramatic morphological alterations, which, at least in one of the two lines, had little clinical consequence. For the other transgenic line, the high frequency of tumor development in F(2) FVB progeny suggests that the vector used to generate the transgenic lines has an integration site-dependent potential to be oncogenic, at least in this strain background.",0

""Medically refractory"" AOM is defined as AOM requiring emergency myringotomy because of toxicity persisting despite second-phase antibiotics. Of these, 18 children were enrolled in our study, with 25 of the ears affected by medically refractory AOM. Myringotomy was performed for pus drainage, bacterial culture and susceptibility studies in all cases. Clinical factors were analyzed to demonstrate possible relationships with microbiological findings.Bacteria were recovered in specimens taken from 12 ears. The positive culture rate was 48%. Bacteriological studies showed mostly growing gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in decreasing order of incidence). The sensitivity rate to pre-myringotomy antibiotics was 85.7%. With the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two ears with intracranial complications or pneumonia, all other isolated microorganisms were susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. No statistically significant differences were noted between culture rates and clinical factors.The distribution of organisms in our medically refractory AOM cases differed from that for simple AOM, with gram-positive bacteria having significantly higher rates of incidence. Combining intravenous aminoglycoside with first-generation cephalosporin is considered an inexpensive and effective treatment covering all potential microorganisms. Vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins are only needed for major complications or other coincident infections extant during the initial presentation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-996411,Optimizing Therapy for Infections Caused by Enterobacteriaceae Producing Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamases,"The spread of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is complicating the treatment of nosocomial infections. In many parts of the world, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins exceeds 10% of total nosocomial isolates and 30% of isolates detected in the intensive care unit. This resistance is frequently due to the acquisition of plasmids containing genes encoding for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Furthermore, these mobile elements often carry genes encoding resistance to other drugs such as aminoglycosides. A high risk of poor clinical outcome has been observed in patients infected with ESBL producers receiving third-generation cephalosporins, even if the organism appears susceptible to the antibiotic. For this reason, clinical microbiology laboratories are advised to incorporate specific ESBL detection methodology into routine clinical practice. This should prevent erroneous use of cephalosporins for these infections. Most ESBL producers remain susceptible to carbapenems, and these agents are considered the drugs of choice against ESBL-producing organisms. Unfortunately, there is now an increasing occurrence of carbapenem resistance in the Enterobacteriaceae. In this context, clinical response to new antibiotics (e.g., tigecycline) and old antibiotics (e.g., colistin) with good in vitro activity against ESBL producers needs to be evaluated.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.05.004,Mother counts: How effects of environmental contaminants on maternal care could affect the offspring and future generations,"Various compounds of anthropogenic origin represent environmental contaminants (EC) that penetrate the food chain and are frequently detected in human milk and maternal blood at the time of delivery. These ECs can affect the development of the fetus and can be transferred to the newborn during lactation. Many studies have used animal models to study the impact of ECs on the development of the nervous system and have reported effects of early exposure on neural and neuroendocrine systems and on behavior, when the exposed animals are tested as adults. Some of these effects persist across generations and may involve epigenetic mechanisms. The majority of these studies in developmental toxicology treat the pregnant or lactating animal with ECs in order to deliver the contaminants to the developing offspring. Almost universally, the mother is viewed as a passive conduit for the ECs, and maternal behavior is rarely assessed. Here we review the literature on the effects of ECs on maternal care and find mounting evidence that important components of the care given to the offspring are affected by maternal exposure to different ECs. Some of these changes in maternal behavior appear to be secondary to changes in the behavior and/or stimulus properties of the exposed offspring, but others are likely to be direct effects of the ECs on the maternal nervous and endocrine systems. Considering the extent to which the quality of maternal care affects the development of the offspring, it becomes imperative to determine the contributions that changes in maternal behavior make to the deficits traditionally ascribed solely to direct effects of ECs on the developing organism. Given the complexity and importance of mother-infant interactions, future research on developmental toxicology must consider the effects of ECs not only on the offspring, but also on the mother and on the interactions and social bond between mother and infant.",1
https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.1550255,Selenium and iodine deficiencies: effects on brain and brown adipose tissue selenoenzyme activity and expression,"Adequate dietary iodine supplies and thyroid hormones are needed for the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) function. Decreases in plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations may increase the requirement for the selenoenzymes types I and II iodothyronine deiodinase (ID-I and ID-II) in the brain and ID-II in BAT to protect against any fall in intracellular 3,3',5 tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations in these organs. We have therefore investigated selenoenzyme activity and expression and some developmental markers in brain and BAT of second generation selenium- and iodine-deficient rats. Despite substantial alterations in plasma thyroid hormone concentrations and thyroidal and hepatic selenoprotein expression in selenium and iodine deficiencies, ID-I, cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGSHPx) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phGSHPx) activities and expression remained relatively constant in most brain regions studied. Additionally, brain and pituitary ID-II activities were increased in iodine deficiency regardless of selenium status. This can help maintain tissue T3 concentrations in hypothyroidism. Consistent with this, no significant effects of iodine or selenium deficiency on the development of the brain were observed, as assessed by the activities of marker enzymes. In contrast, BAT from selenium- and iodine deficient rats had impaired thyroid hormone metabolism and less uncoupling protein than in tissue from selenium- and iodine-supplemented animals. Thus, the effects of selenium and iodine deficiency on the brain are limited due to the activation of the compensatory mechanisms but these mechanisms are less effective in BAT.",1

Sch 34343 had good activity (less than 2 mg/l) against most Gram-negative aerobic bacteria whether or not they contained high levels of plasmid-mediated or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. It was slightly less potent against strains of Morganella and Serratia (less than 4 mg/l) and inactive against Pseudomonas (greater than 64 mg/l). A very small inoculum effect was observed against strains containing beta-lactamases indicating stability. Unlike the third-generation cephalosporins, Sch 34343 had excellent activity (less than or equal to 0.18 mg/l) against staphylococci, comparable to that of imipenem and ampicillin. While Sch 34343 had equally good potency (0.17 mg/l) against penicillinase-positive staphylococci, it was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (greater than or equal to 35 mg/l). Sch 34343 also had good activity against streptococci. The most unusual aspect of the in-vitro activity was its activity against Bacteroides (including Bact. fragilis) and other anaerobes. Sch 34343 had mean MICs less than or equal to mg/l for all Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. tested except CI. difficile (3.4 mg/l).",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/jf60191a011,Insecticides in the tissues of four generations of rats fed different dietary fats containing a mixture of chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides,"The persistent occurrence of traces of some of the chlorinated hydroca.rbon insecticides (CHI) in our food supply is well recognized. The levels for all except dieldrin remain considerably below currently permissible levels (FAO/WHO, 1968). Many of these insecticides are found regularly in body tissues of humans at levels higher than those in the food supply. There is little information, however, about the possible effect that the continuing longtime ingestion of these insecticides may have on reproductive performance and on the health of succeeding generations. Much of the long-term research with the rat as the experimental animal has dealt with the response to low fat commercial-type animal diets to which have been added one or occasionally a mixture of two of these insecticides. The need for more information on the response to mixtures of insecticides is apparent from the increasing evidence of their interaction with each other (Street et al., 1969a). The possibility that the kind and level of fat in the diet may influence the accumulation in the tissues of the fat-soluble CHI also needs consideration. The research reported here was undertaken to determine the response of four generaticins of rats to diets containing a mixture of CHI in proportions found in our food supply. Fat was fed at a level similar to that consumed in the United States. This report deals with the concentrations of insecticides found in the tissues of the weanling and adult rats fed diets containing; DDT, DDE, DDD, dieldrin, lindane, BHC, heptachlor epoxide, methoxychlor, and Perthane. The physiological response to these diets will be the subject of a sepayate report.",1

Although the pathogenic mechanism is not fully understood, reactive oxygen species have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis in experimental studies. By measuring 8-iso-PGF2alpha and protein carbonyls, radical oxygen damage to lipids and proteins can be estimated. The aim of this study was to investigate the status of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation in mothers and fetuses in experimental diabetic pregnancy.Non-pregnant and pregnant rats with and without streptozotocin-induced diabetes were studied after 4 weeks of diabetes or at gestational day 19, respectively. Gross morphology of the offspring was studied and 24 h urine, plasma, amniotic fluid, maternal and fetal livers were collected. Concentrations of 8-iso-PGF2alpha, 15-keto-DH-PGF2alpha and other oxidative stress variables were measured.Malformation and resorption rates were increased in diabetic litters, whereas fetal weights were decreased in the control rats. There were no statistically significant differences in maternal plasma concentrations of 8-iso-PGF2alpha, but plasma protein carbonyl content was increased in the diabetic groups. Pregnancy increased 24 h urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF2alpha in diabetic rats but not in the control rats. There was no difference in the amniotic fluid concentration of 8-iso-PGF2alpha between the normal and the diabetic group. However, in the diabetic group there was a correlation between the uterine horn concentration of 8-iso-PGF2alpha and the percentage of resorptions.In diabetic pregnancy, both diabetes and pregnancy are promoting oxygen radical damage. Fetal oxidative stress markers do not clearly reflect fetal morphology.",0
,Combined ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and MTBE instillation in the treatment of common bile duct stones.,"We report on our initial experience in the treatment of 4 patients with common bile duct stones with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, either alone or in combination with methyl-tert-butyl ether. In four patients, common bile duct stones were successfully fragmented employing a second-generation ultrasound-guided piezoelectric lithotripter (EDAP LT-01). In two of these patients direct application of methyl-tert-butyl ether to the gallstone was utilized to assist in dissolution. There was no mortality or morbidity attributable to either treatment modality. In this first report of this combination of treatments we conclude that ESWL probably has a complementary role to play in the management of patients with common bile duct stones.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/18.5.1021,Induction and repair inhibition of oxidative DNA damage by nickel(II) and cadmium(II) in mammalian cells,"Compounds of nickel(II) and cadmium(II) are carcinogenic to humans and to experimental animals. One frequently discussed mechanism involved in tumor formation is an increase in reactive oxygen species by both metals with the subsequent generation of oxidative DNA damage. In the present study we used human HeLa cells to investigate the potential of nickel(II) and cadmium(II) to induce DNA lesions typical for oxygen free radicals in intact cells and the effect on their repair. As indicators of oxidative DNA damage, we determined the frequencies of DNA strand breaks and of lesions recognized by the bacterial formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein), including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-hydroxyguanine), a pre-mutagenic DNA base modification. Nickel(II) caused a slight increase in DNA strand breaks at 250 microM and higher, while the frequency of Fpg-sensitive sites was enhanced only at the cytotoxic concentration of 750 microM. The repair of oxidative DNA lesions induced by visible light was reduced at 50 microM and at 100 microM nickel(II) for Fpg-sensitive sites and DNA strand breaks, respectively; the removal of both types of lesions was blocked nearly completely at 250 microM nickel(II). In the case of cadmium(II), DNA strand breaks occurred at 10 microM and no Fpg-sensitive sites were detected. However, the repair of Fpg-sensitive DNA lesions induced by visible light was reduced at 0.5 microM cadmium(II) and higher, while the closure of DNA strand breaks was not affected. Since oxidative DNA damage is continuously induced during aerobic metabolism, an impaired repair of these lesions might well explain the carcinogenic action of nickel(II) and cadmium(II).",0

The first generation rats of these descendants were born to mothers parathyroidectomized (Px) on the fifth day of gestation and subsequent generation rats were developed by brother-sister mating without any special treatment. More than 50% of the eighth to tenth generation (F8-F10) offsprings of the Px-rats showed regular 4-day estrous cycles at 15-16 months of age, while nearly 80% of normal F8-F10 rats developed persistent estrus at 13-14 months of age. In 14-15 month-old Px-offspring rats the LH and FSH surges occurred at 1630-1730 h of proestrus to a similar extent as those shown in 3-4 month-old normal rats. The release of LH and FSH following a single injection of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in 13 month-old Px-offspring rats was nearly normal, reaching a maximal level at 15 min as in young adult rats. In 13 month-old normal rats, serum LH measured after an injection of LHRH increased progressively until 60 min. The ovaries of the Px-offspring rats were heavier than those of age-matched normal rats and included well-developed corpora lutea and follicles in several sizes. The results suggest a delay in the aging process of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis of the Px-offspring rats.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1673-8527(09)60020-5,DNA cytosine methylation in plant development,"Cytosine bases of the nuclear genome in higher plants are often extensively methylated. Cytosine methylation has been implicated in the silencing of both transposable elements (TEs) and endogenous genes, and loss of methylation may have severe functional consequences. The recent methylation profiling of the entire Arabidopsis genome has provided novel insights into the extent and pattern of cytosine methylation and its relationships with gene activity. In addition, the fresh studies also revealed the more dynamic nature of this epigenetic modification across plant development than previously believed. Cytosine methylation of gene promoter regions usually inhibits transcription, but methylation in coding regions (gene-body methylation) does not generally affect gene expression. Active demethylation (though probably act synergistically with passive loss of methylation) of promoters by the 5-methyl cytosine DNA glycosylase or DEMETER (DME) is required for the uni-parental expression of imprinting genes in endosperm, which is essential for seed viability. The opinion that cytosine methylation is indispensible for normal plant development has been reinforced by using single or combinations of diverse loss-of-function mutants for DNA methyltransferases, DNA glycosylases, components involved in siRNA biogenesis and chromatin remodeling factors. Patterns of cytosine methylation in plants are usually faithfully maintained across organismal generations by the concerted action of epigenetic inheritance and progressive correction of strayed patterns. However, some variant methylation patterns may escape from being corrected and hence produce novel epialleles in the affected somatic cells. This, coupled with the unique property of plants to produce germline cells late during development, may enable the newly acquired epialleles to be inherited to future generations, which if visible to selection may contribute to adaptation and evolution.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-006-9033-z,Linking Substance Use and Problem Behavior Across Three Generations,"This study examined patterns of between-generation continuity in substance use from generation 1 (G1) parents to generation 2 (G2) adolescents and from G2 adult substance use and G1 substance use to generation 3 (G3) problem behavior in childhood. Structural equation modeling of prospective, longitudinal data from 808 participants, their parents, and their children showed low levels of G1 to G2 cross-generational continuity in the general tendency to use drugs. This effect was fully mediated by G2 early adolescent behavior problems. Drug-specific residual effects were observed across generations for cigarette smoking. Once established in adolescence, substance use in G2 showed stability over time. G2 substance use at age 27 significantly predicted G3 problem behavior. G1 substance use also was related to G3 problem behavior indirectly. These findings highlight the importance of interrupting intergenerational cycles of substance use and problem behavior.",1

However, caudate nuclei volumes (CNV) of untreated first-episode patients may even be smaller than in healthy controls. We investigated whether CNV of newly diagnosed neuroleptic-naive psychotic patients differ as compared to an age- and sex-matched healthy control group to detect possible treatment effects early in the course of this illness. Magnetic resonance images were acquired in 37 un-medicated psychotic patients and 37 healthy controls. Ten of the patients were re-examined after 12 weeks of treatment with the second generation antipsychotic quetiapine. Regions of interest (ROI) delineating the caudate nuclei bilaterally were drawn manually using Brain Image software. The neuroleptic-naive patients showed a mean CNV of 8.40 cc (SD=1.01) and the controls of 8.55 cc (SD=1.16). There was no significant difference between groups (F=.600; P=.441). In contrast to previous studies in patients treated with typical neuroleptics, this cross-sectional MRI study did not find significant differences in CNV of neuroleptic-naive first-episode patients compared to healthy controls.",0

Using the rat model of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), we previously identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with EAU on rat chromosomes 4, 12, and 10 (Eau1, Eau2, and Eau3). The primary goal of the current study is to delineate additional non-MHC chromosomal regions that control susceptibility to EAU, and to identify any QTLs that overlap with the QTLs of other autoimmune diseases. Using a set of informative microsatellite markers and F2 generations of resistant and susceptible MHC class II-matched rat strains (F344 and LEW), we have identified several new significant or suggestive QTLs on rat chromosomes 2, 3, 7, 10, and 19 that control susceptibility to EAU. A protective allele was identified in the susceptible LEW strain in the Eau5 locus at D7Wox18, and epistatic interactions between QTLs were found to influence the severity of disease. The newly identified regions (Eau4 through Eau9) colocalize with the genetic determinants of other autoimmune disease models, and to disease-regulating syntenic regions identified in autoimmune patients on human chromosomes 4q21-31, 5q31-33, 16q22-24, 17p11-q12, 20q11-13, and 22q12-13. Our results suggest that uveitis shares some of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with other autoimmune diseases, and lends support to the “common gene, common pathway” hypothesis for autoimmune disorders.",0

In this syndrome antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers is underused because of their adverse metabolic effects. The aim was to review the evidences supporting the reasons for underusing beta-blockers in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. A review of Literature has been carried out via PubMed from 1998 to 2008: most of beta-blockers have adverse effects on insulin sensitivity, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and are not recommended in metabolic syndrome. However, some recent large studies have shown a better metabolic profile with newer third generation vasodilating beta-blockers, such as Carvedilol and Nebivolol. Vasodilating action of Carvedilol and Nebivolol, due respectively to alpha1-blocking effect and release of nitric oxide, explains the lack of adverse metabolic effects of these beta-blockers that could also be used in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/0959-8049(93)90075-q,Trends in lung cancer mortality in three broad Italian geographical areas between 1969 and 1987,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Trends in death certification rates from lung cancer in broad Italian geographical areas (north/centre/south) were analysed over the period 1969–1987. In northern Italy, lung cancer rates in young and middle-aged males reached a peak between the mid and late 1970s, and tended to decline afterwards; only above age 60 was mortality still rising in the 1980s. A similar pattern of age-specific rates was observed in central areas, while in the South rates tended to level off in the early 1980s only below age 55, but were still upwards in subsequent age groups. Consequently, the north/south ratio for the overall age-standard rate increased slightly between the late 1960s and mid 1970s, from 1.68 (corresponding to a world standardised rate of 47.1100 000 in the north vs. 28.1 in the south) to 1.73, but declined to 1.55 between 1985 and 1987 (for a rate of 69.1100 000 males in the north vs. 44.6 in south). In the younger are groups a diverging pattern was observed: at ages of 25–34 rates in 1985 and 1987 were apparently higher in the south (1.0 vs. 0.9100 000 in the north), and in the 35–44 age group the north/south ratio decreased from 1.7 to 1.2 (with rates of 12.9 and 10.7, respectively, in 1985 and 1987). Among females, lung cancer rates increased in all geographical areas and age groups except the youngest (25–34 years). Under the age of 50, the rises were proportionally similar in various geographical areas, thus widening the north/south difference in absolute terms. Above the age of 50, the north/south difference tended to be wider in relative terms too, reaching a factor of 2 in the 65–74 age group. The overall age-standardised north/south ratio for females increased from 1.51 in 1969–1974 (5.6 vs. 3.7100 000) to 1.87 in 1985–1987 (8.4 vs. 4.5100 000). These trends reflect changes in smoking habits in subsequent generations of Italian males and females from different areas of the country, and confirm the central role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer rates in various populations, although this does not exclude some influence by other, mainly occupational, lung carcinogens on the substantial differences in lung cancer rates in various Italian geographical areas.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1647644,Haemophilia A in a Female: Study of a Family Using Intragenic and Extragenic Restriction Site Polymorphisms,"Summary Restriction fragment length polymorphisms(RFLPs) were studied in a large Algerian family which includes 6 haemophiliacs and a previously described case of female haemophilia A. The female propositus is 66 years old with a normal karyotype. Her parents are first cousins. Her 3 sons are haemophiliacs and her 3 daughters with affected children are obligate carriers. The proband has an excessive bleeding tendency and markedly reduced levels of F. VIII (VIII C 0.03 U/ml, VIII Ag 0.01 U/ml) with elevated vWF Ag (2.30 U/ml), similar to the levels observed in affected males from the family. Four RFLPs can be identified by Southern blotting after digesting genomic DNA with the restriction enzymes Bcl I, Bgl I, Kpn I/Xba I and Taq I and hybridization with a 647 bp Stu I/Sca I F. VIII genomic probe, a 1.8 Kb EcoRI F. VIII cDNA probe, a 1.0 Kb EcoRI/Sst I fragment of intron 22 and the extragenic probe ST 14, respectively. With these four RFLPS, the propositus was found to be homozygous for the alleles segregating in this family with the abnormal X-chromosome. The carrier status was proven in a granddaughter and excluded in another. In conclusion, this RFLP linkage analysis is another argument to suggest that the propositus, a rare case of female haemophilia, is homozygous for the abnormal gene.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.6800249,Rapid response to artificial selection on flower size in Phlox,"Quantitative characters are often said to evolve rather slowly, taking many generations to exhibit appreciable differences among populations. We tested this notion experimentally by performing bi-directional selection on corolla diameter of plants from a wild population of Phlox drummondii for three generations. By monitoring flower size, tube length and stigma-anther proximity of flowers, we obtained the direct and indirect responses to selection, and calculated genetic correlations, realized and narrow sense heritabilities using offspring-mother regression. Realized heritability of flower size was high (0.83), whereas genetic correlations among traits were weak or not significant. The per-generation average of the response in corolla diameter was about 5%. We found that P. drummondii has a great capacity to respond rapidly to selection, and this capacity may be in part responsible for the observed high degree of differentiation within the species. We also concluded that rapid evolution of morphological floral traits is possible.",0

It unknown whether the health benefits and costs of routine nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) are justified, given the availability of newer fourth-generation immunoassay tests.Using a dynamic HIV transmission model instantiated with U.S. epidemiologic, demographic, and behavioral data, I estimated the number of acute infections identified, HIV infections prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies. I varied the target population (everyone aged 15-64, injection drug users [IDUs] and men who have sex with men [MSM], or MSM only), screening frequency (annually, or every six months), and test(s) utilized (fourth-generation immunoassay only, or immunoassay followed by pooled NAAT).Annual immunoassay testing of MSM reduces incidence by 9.5% and costs <$10,000 per QALY gained. Adding pooled NAAT identifies 410 AHI per year, prevents 9.6% of new cases, costs $92,000 per QALY gained, and remains <$100,000 per QALY gained in settings where undiagnosed HIV prevalence exceeds 4%. Screening IDUs and MSM annually with fourth-generation immunoassay reduces incidence by 13% with cost-effectiveness <$10,000 per QALY gained. Increasing the screening frequency to every six months reduces incidence by 11% (MSM only) or 16% (MSM and IDUs) and costs <$20,000 per QALY gained.Pooled NAAT testing every 12 months of MSM and IDUs in the United States prevents a modest number of infections, but may be cost-effective given sufficiently high HIV prevalence levels. However, testing via fourth-generation immunoassay every six months prevents a greater number of infections, is more economically efficient, and may obviate the benefits of acute HIV screening via NAAT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2009.06.060,"The search for potent, small molecule NNRTIs: A review","AIDS has become the leading pandemic disease, and is the cause of death worldwide. Presently, HAART treatment, a combination of reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease inhibitors is also unsuccessful due to the virus getting resistant to the drugs because of mutational changes. Two types of RT inhibitors exist namely nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The NNRTIs which bind to an allosteric site on RT are an important arsenal of drugs against HIV-1. The specificity of NNRTIs towards HIV-1 has led to extensive structural and molecular modelling studies of enzyme complexes and chemical synthesis of second and third-generation NNRTIs. The major drawbacks of NNRTIs are generation of resistance and pharmacokinetic problems. By mutational studies of non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) some amino acids which were found to play an important role in proper binding resulted less prone to mutation. In this review we present a chronological history of NNRTI development, also highlighting the need for small molecules belonging to the NNRTI class for the management of AIDS.",0

However, the technical prerequisites for volumetric, time-resolved imaging of the passage of a contrast medium bolus through the myocardium have only been met with latest generation wide-detector CT scanners. Second-generation dual-source CT enables performing electrocardiographic (ECG)-synchronized dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging by a dedicated ""shuttle"" mode. With this acquisition mode, image data can be acquired during contrast medium infusion at 2 alternating table positions with the table shuttling back and forth between the 2 positions covering a 73-mm anatomic volume. We applied this acquisition technique for detecting differences in perfusion patterns between healthy and diseased myocardium and for quantifying myocardial blood flow under adenosine stress in 3 patients with coronary heart disease. According to our initial experience, the addition of adenosine stress volumetric dynamic CT perfusion to a cardiac CT protocol comprising coronary artery calcium quantification, prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CT angiography, and delayed acquisition appears promising for the comprehensive assessment of coronary artery luminal integrity, cardiac function, perfusion, and viability with a single modality.",0

Fractures of the alumina-bearing couple are rare for the same reason.This article describes a case of a fracture of an alumina-bearing couple delta ceramic liner without trauma history that was treated with ceramic-on-polyethylene revision total hip arthroplasty. A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hip ward because of an alumina-bearing couple delta ceramic liner fracture. He underwent hip replacement by anterior approach 18 months previously in the same center because of left hip primary osteoarthritis. He received a 54×36-mm modular press-fit cup ceramic alumina-bearing couple delta insert. Probable causes of such fractures are manufacture production failure and edge loading based on cup inclination, but in our patient, inacceptable range of motion, failure of the locking mechanism during implantation insertion, or cracking were possible causes of fracture.Although the fracture rate of third-generation alumina-bearing couples is low, we believe that it may not be possible to eliminate the actual risk of alumina head fracture. Patients should be informed about the potential for this complication before receiving an alumina-bearing couple.",0

Genetic factors play an important role in both the onset and severity of the condition, with mutations in several ion-channel genes being implicated, including those encoding the GABAA receptor. Here, we evaluated the frequency of additional mutations in the GABAA receptor by direct sequencing of the complete open reading frame of the GABRA1 and GABRG2 genes from a cohort of French Canadian families with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Using this approach, we have identified three novel mutations that were absent in over 400 control chromosomes. In GABRA1, two mutations were found, with the first being a 25-bp insertion that was associated with intron retention (i.e. K353delins18X) and the second corresponding to a single point mutation that replaced the aspartate 219 residue with an asparagine (i.e. D219N). Electrophysiological analysis revealed that K353delins18X and D219N altered GABAA receptor function by reducing the total surface expression of mature protein and/or by curtailing neurotransmitter effectiveness. Both defects would be expected to have a detrimental effect on inhibitory control of neuronal circuits. In contrast, the single point mutation identified in the GABRG2 gene, namely P83S, was indistinguishable from the wildtype subunit in terms of surface expression and functionality. This finding was all the more intriguing as the mutation exhibited a high degree of penetrance in three generations of one French Canadian family. Further experimentation will be required to understand how this mutation contributes to the occurrence of IGE in these individuals.",0

Such an epigenetic code of the core components of chromatin, DNA and histone proteins , can thus be stable but is also highly dynamic. In the nervous system, epigenetic codes are critical for basic cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity , and for complex behaviours such as learning and memory. At the same time, epigenetic marks can be stably transmitted through mitosis and meiosis, and thereby underlie non-genomic transgenerational inheritance of behavioural traits. In this review, we describe recent findings on the role and mechanisms of epigenetic codes in the brain, and discuss their implication in synaptic plasticity, cognitive functions and psychiatric disorders . We provide examples of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks that affect simple morphological traits or complex processes such as disease susceptibility, and point to the potential implication of epigenetic codes in medicine and evolution.",1

Horseradish peroxidase covalently linked to avidin is the second conjugate. First, serum or plasma is incubated with the antibody-coated bead and biotin-labeled antibodies, simultaneously, at 45 degrees C for 1 h (""stat"" procedure), 3 h (""standard"" procedure), or 18 h (""overnight"" procedure), during which HBsAg forms a complex with the solid-phase antibody and the biotinylated antibodies. The enzyme-conjugated avidin is then bound to the biotin on the antigen-antibody complex at 45 degrees C for 15 min (""stat"") or 30 min (standard and overnight procedures). The beads are incubated with enzyme-substrate solution (H2O2 and o-phenylenediamine). Color developed is measured at 492 nm. All procedures satisfied third-generation HBsAg tests required by the FDA Office of Biologics, being sensitive both to ad and ay subtypes in subnanogram amounts. The assay is reactive with adw2, adw4, adr, ayw2, ayw3, and ayr subtypes and can detect viral determinants in HBsAg-anti-HBs immune complex form. Thus it provides a sensitive, simple, and reproducible alternative to radioimmunoassay.",0

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2000-13597,The Central Oval of the Face: Tridimensional Endoscopic Rejuvenation,"The central oval of the face is a distinct anatomic and aesthetic unit. Early signs of aging and advanced features of aging are manifested primarily in this unit. Standard face lift techniques are ineffective in treating this area. Intermediate layer (sub-SMAS, [superior musculo-aponeurotic system], intermuscular, etc.) and deep layer (subperiosteal) techniques were developed to treat this rather difficult part of the face. All variations of the intermediate layer technique have negative features, primarily safety issues related to potential nerve-muscle injury and protracted facial edema. Early described subperiosteal techniques (open, first generation endoscopic) were also associated with these types of complications. The author has outlined 14 principles of the ideal technique for the rejuvenation of the central oval. The advances and modifications to the first and second generation endoscopic central oval rejuvenation method comply with these principles. There are several principles that distinctly separate it from all other techniques: (1) direct approach to the central oval; (2) interconnected subperiosteal plane of dissection to the upper and midface; (3) use of small hidden slit incisions; (4) absence of eyelid incisions; (5) use of endoscopic techniques; and (6) absence of traction on skin or SMAS from the peripheral hemicircle. Another important advance made in this approach is the manipulation of soft tissues in the brow, glabella, cheek, and chin to provide a tridimensional rejuvenation. This was lacking in all previously described procedures. This method has been used with several modifications in over 500 patients. Aesthetic results have been excellent, with minimal sequela and a low complication rate. The subset of patients in whom this third generation endoscopic subperiosteal approach has been used have also had a three-dimensional remodeling and enhancement. The aesthetic results and safety factors surpass all other previously described techniques done at the intermediate or deep layers of the face.",0

This approach does not require prior knowledge of the identity of the genes that are involved and is a way to ascribe function to the nearly 6000 genes for which knowledge of the DNA sequence has been inadequate to determine the function of the gene product. In an effort to identify genes involved in the visual system via this approach, we have tested over 9000 first and third generation offspring of mice treated with the mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) for visual defects, as evidenced by abnormalities in the electroretinogram and appearance of the fundus. We identified 61 putative mutations with this procedure and outline the steps needed to identify the affected genes.",1

Clinicians rely on many tools, including guidelines, to make these treatment decisions. Such guidelines include the St Gallen consensus statement, the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, as well as various regional and national guidelines. Recommendations may vary, because different methods and criteria were used to assess the strength of supporting data. This article provides an overview of global guidelines for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and points out the major differences. Ongoing changes are highlighted, particularly those regarding the adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal women with breast cancer. While previous guidelines recommended tamoxifen alone, all major guidelines now recommend using third-generation aromatase inhibitors either in sequence with tamoxifen or as upfront treatment.",0

Bursa of Fabricius to body weight ratios were depressed in the survivors in each line, but no differences were observed between lines. However, histological examination of bursae from survivors showed that, although bursal damage occurred in every line, it was most severe in the two lines (BrL and White Leghorn W1) in which the highest mortality was recorded. Experiments with F1 matings between highly susceptible and highly resistant lines showed that resistance was partially dominant and that there were no maternal effects. Experiments using F2 and backcross chicks suggested the involvement of a single gene and indicated no involvement of the MHC. There was considerable variation between lines in IBDV-specific antibody, measured by ELISA, both in the vaccinated parent hens and in the amounts of inherited maternal antibody and its rate of decay in the progeny.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/1099-9809.12.1.84,Differences in family functioning in grandparent and parent-headed households in a clinical sample of drug-using African American adolescents.,"Grandparents play a critical role in African American families, providing support and important leadership functions. Little is known, however, about family functioning in grandparent-headed households with a drug-using adolescent. Such knowledge is particularly salient for researchers and therapists who work with drug-using adolescents and their families. Using a clinical sample of convenience, analyses were conducted to identify similarities and differences in adolescent substance use and behavior problems, family relationships, and family social ecology relationships between African American grandparent-headed (n=12) and parent-headed (n=54) households. Results indicated that adolescents from the 2 household types reported similar levels of problem behaviors, but that grandparents reported less delinquency with peers than did parents. Primary caregivers in grandparent-headed households reported less monitoring and supervision of peers and less within-family conflict. Implications for treatment are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/des439,Preventing the transmission of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations: can we achieve long-term benefits from germ-line gene transfer?,"Mitochondrial medicine is one of the few areas of genetic disease where germ-line transfer is being actively pursued as a treatment option. All of the germ-line transfer methods currently under development involve some carry-over of the maternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy, potentially delivering the pathogenic mutation to the offspring. Rapid changes in mtDNA heteroplasmy have been observed within a single generation, and so any 'leakage' of mutant mtDNA could lead to mtDNA disease in future generations, compromising the reproductive health of the first generation, and leading to repeated interventions in subsequent generations. To determine whether this is a real concern, we developed a model of mtDNA heteroplasmy inheritance by studying 87 mother-child pairs, and predicted the likely outcome of different levels of 'mutant mtDNA leakage' on subsequent maternal generations. This showed that, for a clinical threshold of 60%, reducing the proportion of mutant mtDNA to <5% dramatically reduces the chance of disease recurrence in subsequent generations, but transmitting >5% mutant mtDNA was associated with a significant chance of disease recurrence. Mutations with a lower clinical threshold were associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Our findings provide reassurance that, at least from an mtDNA perspective, methods currently under development have the potential to effectively eradicate pathogenic mtDNA mutations from subsequent generations.",0

However, such tumour-specific immune cells are not readily obtained from the host due to poor immunogenicity of tumours and reduced host immune responses. One obstacle in implementation of adoptive immunotherapy has been insufficient sensitization and expansion of tumour-specific effector cells. In this study, we aim to improve adoptive immunotherapy by generating anti-tumour effector T cells from naïve T lymphocytes. We attempted to achieve this by harnessing the advantages of dendritic cell (DC)-based anti-cancer vaccine strategies. Electrofusion was routinely employed to produce fusion cells with 30-40% efficiency by using the poorly immunogenic murine B16/F10 cell line, D5 cells, and DC generated from bone marrow cells. CD62L-positive T cells from spleens of naïve mice and the fusion cells were cocultured with a low concentration of IL-2. After 9 days of culture, the antigen-specific T cells were identified with an upregulation of CD25 and CD69 expression and a downregulation of CD62L expression. These cells secreted IFN-gamma upon stimulation with irradiated tumour cells. Moreover, when transferred into mice with 3-day established pulmonary metastases, these cells with coadministration of IL-2 exhibited anti-tumour efficacy. In contrast, naïve T cells cocultured with a mixture of unfused DC and irradiated tumour cells did not exhibit anti-tumour efficacy. Our strategy provides the basis for a new approach in adoptive T cell immunotherapy for cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-3458.2005.tb00048.x,Preclinical Neuropharmacology of Naratriptan,"The basic CNS neuropharmacology of naratriptan is reviewed here. Naratriptan is a second-generation triptan antimigraine drug, developed at a time when CNS activity was thought not to be relevant to its therapeutic effect in migraine. It was, however, developed to be a more lipid-soluble, more readily absorbed and less readily metabolized variant on preexisting triptans and these variations conferred on it a higher CNS profile. Naratriptan is a 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with a highly selective action on migraine pain and nausea, without significant effect on other pain or even other trigeminal pain. Probable sites of therapeutic action of naratriptan include any or all of: the cranial vasculature; the peripheral terminations of trigeminovascular sensory nerves; the first-order synapses of the trigeminovascular sensory system; the descending pain control system; and the nuclei of the thalamus. Naratriptan may prevent painful dilatation of intracranial vessels or reverse such painful dilatation. Naratriptan can prevent the release of sensory peptides and inhibit painful neurogenic vasodilatation of intracranial blood vessels. At the first order synapse of the trigeminal sensory system, naratriptan can selectively suppress neurotransmission from sensory fibers from dural and vascular tissue, while sparing transmission from other trigeminal fibers, probably through inhibition of neuropeptide transmitter release. In the periaqueductal gray matter and in the nucleus raphe magnus, naratriptan selectively activates inhibitory neurons which project to the trigeminal nucleus and spinal cord and which exert inhibitory influences on trigeminovascular sensory input. Naratriptan has also a therapeutic effect on the nausea of migraine, possibly exerting its action at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarius via the same mechanisms by which it inhibits trigeminovascular nociceptive input. The incidence of naratriptan-induced adverse effects in the CNS is low and it is not an analgesic for pain other than that of vascular headache. In patients receiving selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) naratriptan may cause serotonin syndrome-like behavioral side effects. The mechanism of action involved in the production of behavioral and other CNS side effects of naratriptan is unknown.",0

The cohort included, as a single risk factor, 35.7% intravenous drug users (IVDUs), 25% homosexual men, 30.1% heterosexual individuals, 5.9% transfused patients, 0.7% occupational infections, and 2.6% patients with unknown infection source, and was studied on entry and in samples collected for up to 36 months. Results showed that on entry (i) sera of 83 out of 272 members of the cohort were positive by the HCV 1st generation EIA (30.5%); 70 were confirmed by the neutralization test (84.3%); (ii) 115 of the cohort were reactive with the 2nd generation HCV EIA (41.3%); (iii) with the dot-blot immunoassay 99 (86.1%) of the cohort were confirmed and 16 remained indeterminate. The overall confirmed HCV antibody-positive rate in these 272 patients was 36.4%. Antibody to HCV was detected in 78.3% of IVDUs, 18.3% of heterosexual individuals, 31.2% of transfused patients, and only 2.9% of homosexual men. The 36-month follow-up of this cohort revealed that 4/145 patients became anti-HCV positive by second generation assay. Hepatitis B markers were frequently associated with HCV in IVDUs (71.1%) but infrequently in heterosexual (8.5%) or homosexual (1.5%) individuals. Our results suggest that HCV 2nd generation EIA used in combination with the semiautomated dot-blot assay as a confirmatory test improves the specificity and sensitivity for HCV antibody detection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0

Research Design and Methods –Twenty-one elderly outpatients (mean age 70 yr) were treated for 8 wk, after being dose-titrated to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of &amp;lt; 7.8 mM with glyburide or glipizide in a randomized crossover trial. FPG and postprandial plasma glucose, serum C-peptide, and HbA1c levels were measured. In 13 patients, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with a memory meter was performed seven times per week. Results –Glipizide (11.9 mg) and glyburide (8.4 mg) produced similar fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and HbA1c concentrations. No significant differences in basal or stimulated C-peptide levels were detected. Despite a few patient reports of hypoglycemia, a high incidence of SMBG readings &amp;lt; 4.5 mM was attributed to the use of both drugs. Conclusions –Both treatments proved effective for glycemic control; however, both second-generation sulfonylureas are associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia in elderly NIDDM patients. The proper use of sulfonylureas in this population should include close surveillance of ambulatory glucose monitoring and intensive and repeated patient education about the risks of hypoglycemia.",0

Conversion of these SNPs to the cost-effective and flexible throughput Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) assays generated successful assays for 2005 SNPs. These marker assays have been designated as Chickpea KASPar Assay Markers (CKAMs). Screening of 70 genotypes including 58 diverse chickpea accessions and 12 BC(3) F(2) lines showed 1341 CKAMs as being polymorphic. Genetic analysis of these data clustered chickpea accessions based on geographical origin. Genotyping data generated for 671 CKAMs on the reference mapping population (Cicer arietinum ICC 4958 × Cicer reticulatum PI 489777) were compiled with 317 unpublished TOG-SNPs and 396 published markers for developing the genetic map. As a result, a second-generation genetic map comprising 1328 marker loci including novel 625 CKAMs, 314 TOG-SNPs and 389 published marker loci with an average inter-marker distance of 0.59 cM was constructed. Detailed analyses of 1064 mapped loci of this second-generation chickpea genetic map showed a higher degree of synteny with genome of Medicago truncatula, followed by Glycine max, Lotus japonicus and least with Vigna unguiculata. Development of these cost-effective CKAMs for SNP genotyping will be useful not only for genetics research and breeding applications in chickpea, but also for utilizing genome information from other sequenced or model legumes.",0

Sick infants and those of working mothers were excluded. The mothers' knowledge of feeding practices was recorded in an interviewer administered questionnaire. The infants' weights, lengths and rectal temperatures were measured and the osmolality of urine estimated. The room temperature and relative humidity were recorded on each day of study. The data were analysed using the Chi-Square statistical test.69% of mothers introduced supplementary fluids within the first 4 months, because of advice from grandmothers or relatives, thirst, hiccups or constipation. 45% had introduced water with ""rathakalkaya"", a fluid traditionally given to infants in Sri Lanka. 90% of mothers had attended antenatal clinics in the De Soysa Hospital for Women. 70% of mothers who gave supplementary fluids were aware of the importance of exclusive breast feeding. The range of urine osomolalities of exclusively breast fed infants was 60 to 204 mosmol/kg. There were no significant differences in core temperatures and number of times urine was voided daily, or urine osmolalities, between exclusively breast fed and fluids-supplemented group of infants.Despite delivery in a baby friendly hospital a majority of mothers supplemented breast milk with water or other fluids during the first 4 months. The advice of grandmothers had a significant influence on early feeding practices.

,[Identification of the first Duchess of Brabant. Anatomo-historical study].,"After World War I, the St. Peter's church at Louvain had to be restored. When the floor of the choir was broken up, a vaulted tomb house, containing a heap of bones, was discovered. The study of the historical past of the church building was committed to Leo Van der Essen, Professor of History at the Louvain university, while Charles Nelis, Professor of Anatomy at the same university, was charged to identify, as far as possible, the discovered bones. Prof. Nelis succeeded in rebuilding three skeletons with bones that fitted together. He chiefly discovered on these skeletons a number of osteological variants, which in fact are known as being very rare; but their frequent existence on the three skeletons and their absence on the other bones, pointed towards an hereditary factor and the kinship of the three persons. By combining Prof. Van der Essen's historical data with his own heredomorphological findings, Prof. Nelis identified in the year 1930 the Dukes of Brabant from the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, namely Godfrey II, Godfrey III and Henry I (father, son and grandson). With the help of the medical historian Dr. Tricot-Royer, Prof. Nelis extended his investigation to other members of the dukes' family, namely Saint Albert, Prince-bishop of Liège and brother of Henry I, whose shrine was preserved in Mechlin, and Henry II, son of Henry I, whose tomb was located in the ruins of the abbey of Villers-la-Ville. By measuring and digging in the gardens of the Affligem-abbey, according to historical documents, Dr. Tricot-Royer could find the graves and the skeletons of the first Duke Godfrey I with the Beard, of his daughter Queen Alice and of Godfrey of Gaesbeeck, brother of Henry II. Thanks to the unusual frequency of the same hereditary traits, the kinship with the first three skeletons was established and the historical indications could be confirmed by the anatomical science. The heredo-morphological pioneer research of Prof. Nelis on eight personages from five generations of the same family is unique.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2006.02.016,A frame shift mutation in canine TPP1 (the ortholog of human CLN2) in a juvenile Dachshund with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are inherited lysosomal storage diseases characterized by progressive neuropathy and the accumulation of autofluorescent cytoplasmic granules. Clinical signs of a new canine NCL began in a 9-month-old male Dachshund with vomiting, mental dullness, and loss of previously learned commands and rapidly progressed to include disorientation, ataxia, visual deficits, generalized myoclonic seizures, and death at 12 months of age. Neurons throughout the CNS contained autofluorescent storage granules that stained with periodic acid-Schiff and Luxol fast blue stains. Electron microscopy revealed that the storage granule contents consisted of curvilinear-appearing material characteristic of human late infantile NCL caused by CLN2 mutations. Nucleotide sequence analysis of canine TPP1, the ortholog of human CLN2, revealed a single nucleotide deletion in exon 4 which predicted a frame shift with a premature stop codon. Brain tissue from the affected dog lacked detectable activity of the tripeptidyl-peptidase enzyme encoded by TPP1, whereas the specific activities of 15 other lysosomal enzymes were higher than those in the brains of three control dogs. The affected Dachshund was homozygous for the mutant c.325delC allele, his sire and dam were heterozygotes, and 181 unrelated dogs, including 77 Dachshunds, were all homozygous for the wild-type allele. A DNA assay that detects the mutant allele will help Dachshund breeders avoid producing affected puppies in future generations. Furthermore, this Dachshund NCL may prove to be a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in human late infantile NCL and for evaluating novel therapeutic interventions for this disease.",0

His mother and three brothers had similar symptoms. The maternal uncle, who has learning disability, had experienced multiple dystonic attacks. Tests performed on the family, including computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain as well as metabolic evaluation, were normal. Cytogenetic analysis was normal and mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed no deletions or mutations in the four affected family members and the grandmother. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is suggested by the fact that both sexes are affected in two generations.",0
,"Veltuzumab, an anti-CD20 mAb for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.","Veltuzumab is a humanized, second-generation anti-CD20 mAb currently under development by Immunomedics Inc for the potential treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Licensee Nycomed is developing veltuzumab for the potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Veltuzumab contains 90 to 95% human antibody sequences with identical antigen framework regions to epratuzumab (a humanized anti-CD22 mAb) and similar antigen-binding determinants to rituximab (chimeric, anti-CD20 mAb and the first-line treatment of aggressive and indolent NHL). In vitro studies have demonstrated that veltuzumab has enhanced binding avidities and a stronger effect on complement-dependent cytotoxicity compared with rituximab in selected cell lines. In dose-finding phase I/II clinical trials in patients with low-grade NHL, intravenous veltuzumab demonstrated a substantial rate of complete responses in concurrence with shorter and more tolerable infusions compared with rituximab. Currently there has been no evidence of an immune response to repeated administrations, and no serious adverse events related to veltuzumab treatment in patients with NHL. Veltuzumab is undergoing clinical trials using a low-dose subcutaneous formulation in patients with NHL, CLL and ITP. Prospective, randomized clinical trials are needed to clarify the role veltuzumab will play in a market where the therapy of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is dominated by rituximab.",0
https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1525285,Physiopathological significance of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions at 2 f1–f2 produced by high- versus low-level stimuli,"Distortion product otoacoustic emissions emitted by the cochlea at 2f1-f2 in response to pairs of pure tones at f1 and f2 (DPOAE) form a class of otoacoustic emissions and as such, are viewed as a reliable tool for screening outer hair cell (OHC) dysfunctions on a pass/fail basis. However, the persistence of residual DPOAEs from impaired cochleae at high stimulus levels has suggested that above 60-70 dB SPL, instead of reflecting ""active"" cochlear motion, DPOAEs might represent another ""passive"" modality: they would thus become unsuitable for analyzing cochlear function. The present work reports the consequences on high- vs low-level DPOAEs of three types of cochlear impairments involving OHCs: progressive OHC degeneration of genetic origin in CD1 mice, complete cochlear ischemia in gerbils, and furosemide injection vs ischemia-reperfusion in gerbils. An alternative to the ""active-passive"" model was used wherein regardless of stimulus level, cubic DPOAEs are produced by N (probably OHC-borne) nonlinear elements driven by input I and modulated by a function F3 of their operating point o; thus, DPOAE proportional to NI3F3(o). When OHCs degenerated, thereby implying a decrease of N, DPOAE levels also decreased regardless of the stimulus level up to 80 dB SPL, in line with the previous formula but at variance with the prediction of the active-passive concept. Instead of affecting N, the other two experiments impaired the efficiency of the cochlear feedback loop as a result of its electrical drive being decreased by strial dysfunction. As it is well accepted that the impaired basilar-membrane motion, although greatly reduced at low levels, tends to catch up with a normal one at higher levels, it was assumed the same was true with I so that DPOAE levels had to be, and indeed were little affected at high levels while plummeting at low levels, without any need for invoking two modalities for DPOAE generation. Finally, comparisons of furosemide vs ischemia effects revealed additional influences on DPOAEs, possibly accounted for by function F3(o). These results lead to the proposal that although high-level DPOAEs are expected to be poor audiometric indicators, they seem well adapted to assessing the functional integrity of nonlinear elements in OHCs, i.e., presumably their mechanoelectrical transduction channels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1161/circinterventions.108.819839,Progress and Current Status of Percutaneous Aortic Valve Replacement: Results of Three Device Generations of the CoreValve Revalving System,"Background— Percutaneous aortic valve replacement is a new emerging technology for interventional treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in surgical high-risk patients. This study was intended to provide a summary of the development and current safety and efficacy status of the self-expanding CoreValve Revalving prosthesis. Method and Results— Between 2005 and 2008, we have enrolled 136 consecutive patients with percutaneous aortic valve replacement using the CoreValve prosthesis. In this prospective nonrandomized, single-center trial, we analyzed procedural outcome, complications and clinical status up to 1 year. First, second, and third generation of the CoreValve prosthesis were implanted in 10, 24, and 102 consecutive high-risk patients (logistic EuroScore: 23.1�15.0%) with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Mean transvalvular pressure gradient was 41.5�16.7 mm Hg. The procedural success rate increased from generation 1/2 to 3 from 70.0%/70.8% to 91.2% ( P =0.003). The 30-day combined rate of death/stroke/myocardial infarction was 40.0%/20.8%/14.7% ( P =0.11) for generation 1, 2, and 3, with no procedural death in generation 3. Pressure gradients improved significantly with a final mean gradient of 8.1�3.8 mm Hg. Overall functional status assessed by New York Heart Association class improved from 3.3�0.5 (pre) to 1.7�0.7 (post) ( P &lt;0.001) and remained stable in the follow-up. Conclusion— In experienced hands, percutaneous aortic valve replacement with the CoreValve system for selected patients with severe aortic valve stenosis has a high acute success rate associated with a low periprocedural mortality/stroke rate as well as remarkable clinical and hemodynamic improvements, which persist over time. Additional studies are now required to confirm these findings, particularly head-to-head comparisons with surgical valve replacement in different risk populations.",0

Instrumented specimens were tested elastically in a biomaterials testing system.Synthetic femora were instrumented with either a statically locked first-generation femoral nail or a statically locked second-generation femoral nail.Elastic stiffness for both the stable and unstable fracture groups was measured in both compression and torsion. Unstable fracture specimens were tested to failure in compression, and load to failure was measured.Throughout the subtrochanteric region, second-generation femoral nail constructs were consistently stiffer in compression and torsion than were statically locked first-generation femoral nail constructs. In general, second-generation constructs also withstood larger loads to failure in the unstable fracture model.Second-generation nails provided significantly enhanced mechanical stiffness compared with first-generation femoral nails when used to treat both stable and unstable subtrochanteric femur fractures. Although these results were obtained by using a well-controlled, mechanically consistent model, clinical validation of an increased incidence of fracture unions or of decreased time to union is required before we can recommend that second-generation nails be used routinely to treat subtrochantenic femur fractures.",0

The goal was to overcome some of the methodological limitations of past research in this area and to provide a preliminary test of the theory that these disorders share a common substrate: a tendency toward behavioral disinhibition.Structured diagnostic interviews and an objective personality measure were used to assess antisocial behavior and somatization in a sample of 90 biological mothers (mean age 34 years) of children referred to an outpatient mental health clinic. A rating scale measure of sensation-seeking behavior was used as a measure of behavioral disinhibition. Structured interviews were used to assess a history of antisocial behavior in the children and their biological fathers.Results indicated a link between somatization and antisocial behavior both within individuals and across generations. This intergenerational link could not be solely accounted for by assortative mating between women with somatization and antisocial men. Both somatization and antisocial behavior were correlated with scores on the sensation seeking scale.These findings are consistent with the theory that antisocial behavior and somatization are related syndromes and that behavioral disinhibition may be a common predisposition that underlies both.",0

A total of 8590 oocytes was used in six independent experiments, each in a randomized complete block design. Each replication within each experiment consisted of oocytes from the same abattoir collection of ovaries. There was no difference in embryo development when oocytes were exposed to ceftiofur sodium during oocyte maturation or fertilization at low (10 and 50 micrograms/mL) or high (100 and 200 micrograms/mL) concentrations. However, when fertilized oocytes were exposed to concentrations > or = 50 micrograms/mL during culture, ceftiofur sodium significantly retarded embryo development (e.g. the numbers of ova developing to the morula and blastocyst stages were reduced, and a large proportion of embryos were blocked at the 8-cell stage). We conclude that ceftiofur sodium does not appear to have detrimental effects on oocyte maturation and fertilization. However, long term exposure to high dosages of ceftiofur sodium during post-fertilization culture adversely affects embryo development in vitro.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201001982,A Second-Generation Photocage for Zn2+ Inspired by TPEN: Characterization and Insight into the Uncaging Quantum Yields of ZinCleav Chelators,"Photocages have been used to elucidate the biological functions of various small molecules and Ca(2+) ; however, there are very few photocages available for other metal ions. ZinCleav-2 (1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine) is a second-generation photocage for Zn(2+) that releases the metal ion after a light-induced bifurcation of the chelating ligand. The structure of ZinCleav-2 was inspired by TPEN (N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine), which is routinely used to sequester metal ions in cells owing to its high binding affinity. Inclusion of a 2-nitrobenzyl chromophore leads to the formation of two more weakly binding di-(2-picolyl)amine (DPA) fragments upon photolysis of the TPEN backbone. The desired ligand was prepared using a modified procedure used to access ZinCleav-1 (1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-bis-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine). ZinCleav-2 has a conditional dissociation constant (K(d) ) of ∼0.9 fM as measured by competitive titration with a quinoline-based fluorescent sensor for Zn(2+). The K(d) of the Zn(2+) complex of the DPA photoproducts is ∼158 nM; therefore, the ΔK(d) for ZinCleav-2 photocage is ∼10(8). A large ΔK(d) is required to significantly perturb free metal ion concentrations in biological assays. The quantum yield of photolysis of apo ZinCleav-2 and the [Zn(ZinCleav-2)](2+) complex are 4.7 and 2.3 %, respectively, as determined by HPLC analysis. Proof of concept Zn(2+) release upon photolysis of [Zn(ZinCleav-2)](2+) was demonstrated using the fluorescent sensor Zinpyr-1, and the speciation of Zn(2+) complexes was simulated using computational methods. The influence of benzylic substituents on the quantum yield of uncaging is also analyzed with the aim of tuning the photochemical properties caged complexes for in vivo experiments.",0
https://doi.org/10.2337/diacare.23.12.1761,Reduced insulin secretion in offspring of African type 2 diabetic parents.,"To determine the early biochemical predictors of increased susceptibility to develop diabetes in offspring of African type 2 diabetic parents.A total of 69 offspring (case subjects) of 26 families in Cameroon with at least one type 2 diabetic parent were studied, and 62 offspring (control subjects) from 25 families in Cameroon with no parent with type 2 diabetes underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Early insulin secretion was calculated using the ratio of the 0- to 30-min incremental insulin values to the 0- to 30-min incremental glucose. Anthropometric parameters were also measured.Of the case subjects, 23% were glucose intolerant (4% with diabetes and 19% with impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) compared with 6.5% (all with IGT) of control subjects (P = 0.02). There was also an increasing prevalence of glucose intolerance, especially IGT with increasing number of glucose-intolerant parents. Fasting serum insulin levels were not different in the two groups; however, at 30 min, the case subjects had lower insulin levels than the control subjects (P < 0.006). Case subjects with IGT had lower 30-min insulin concentration, early insulin secretion, and 2-h insulin levels than those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (F = 4.1, P < 0.05; F = 4.1, P < 0.04; and F = 5.1, P < 0.03, respectively). Furthermore, case subjects with NGT and IGT had lower early insulin secretion than control subjects (F = 4. 1, P < 0.03). These differences remained after adjustment for BMI and regardless of the status of parental diabetes. Two-hour insulin concentration showed a positive association (odds ratio = 0.95 CI 0.90-0.99, P = 0.039) with IGT in the case subjects.Diabetes and IGT are more prevalent in the offspring of African type 2 diabetic parents, and this may be due to an underlying degree of beta-cell impairment marked by reduced early-phase insulin secretion.",0

KU-7-luc cells that stably express luciferase were inoculated in female nude mice by intravesical instillation and tumour size was measured using bioluminescence imaging. Mice with established KU-7-luc tumours were administered uncomplexed 'naked' OGX-427 or MM ODN as well as controlled-release microparticulate chitosan/oligonucleotide formulations intravesically. Tumour growth was monitored over time and tumours were analysed after death using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.In vitro, OGX-427 significantly decreased HSP27 protein levels and cellular viability. While naked OGX-427 showed only a trend in tumour suppression compared with MM ODN, OGX-427 complexed with chitosan significantly inhibited orthotopic tumour growth. The chitosan preparation induced some haematuria compared to naked ASO, but this formulation had superior tissue uptake of oligonucleotides and suppressed HSP27 tissue levels by 75%.Intravesical OGX-427 instillation therapy showed promising antitumour activity and minimal toxicity in an orthotopic mouse model of high-grade bladder cancer. These findings provide pre-clinical proof-of-principle for the use of ASO as intravesical agents for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and warrant further evaluation of efficacy and safety in early-phase clinical trials.",0

https://doi.org/10.1136/jmg.2003.016584,Large scale association analysis for identification of genes underlying premature coronary heart disease: cumulative perspective from analysis of 111 candidate genes,"to date, only three groups have reported data from large scale genetic association studies of coronary heart disease using a case control design.to extend our initial report of 62 genes, we present data for 210 polymorphisms in 111 candidate genes genotyped in 352 white subjects with familial, premature coronary heart disease (onset age for men, 45; for women, 50) and a random sample of 418 population based whites. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compare the distributions of genotypes between cases and the comparison group while controlling for age, sex, body mass, diabetes, and hypertension. Significant associations were found with polymorphisms in thrombospondin-4 (THBS4), thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI2), the strongest being with the A387P variant in THBS4 (p = 0.002). The THBS2 and THBS4 associations have since been replicated. We evaluated polymorphisms in 40 genes previously associated with coronary heart disease and found significant (p<0.05) associations with 10: ACE, APOE, F7, FGB, GP1BA, IL1RN, LRP1, MTHFR, SELP, and THPO. For five of these genes, the polymorphism associated in our study was different from that previously reported, suggesting linkage disequilibrium as an explanation for failure to replicate associations consistently across studies. We found strong linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms within and between genes, especially on chromosome 1q22-q25, a region containing several candidate genes.despite known caveats of genetic association studies, they can be an effective means of hypothesis generation and complement classic linkage studies for understanding the genetic basis of coronary heart disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-8-44,Involvement of gut microbial fermentation in the metabolic alterations occurring in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids-depleted mice,"Abstract Backround Western diet is characterized by an insufficient n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption which is known to promote the pathogenesis of several diseases. We have previously observed that mice fed with a diet poor in n-3 PUFA for two generations exhibit hepatic steatosis together with a decrease in body weight. The gut microbiota contributes to the regulation of host energy metabolism, due to symbiotic relationship with fermentable nutrients provided in the diet. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that perturbations of the gut microbiota contribute to the metabolic alterations occurring in mice fed a diet poor in n-3 PUFA for two generations (n-3/- mice). Methods C57Bl/6J mice fed with a control or an n-3 PUFA depleted diet for two generations were supplemented with prebiotic (inulin-type Fructooligosaccharides, FOS, 0.20 g/day/mice) during 24 days. Results n-3/-mice exhibited a marked drop in caecum weight, a decrease in lactobacilli and an increase in bifidobacteria in the caecal content as compared to control mice (n-3/+ mice). Dietary supplementation with FOS for 24 days was sufficient to increase caecal weight and bifidobacteria count in both n-3/+ and n-3/-mice. Moreover, FOS increased lactobacilli content in n-3/-mice, whereas it decreased their level in n-3/+ mice. Interestingly, FOS treatment promoted body weight gain in n-3/-mice by increasing energy efficiency. In addition, FOS treatment decreased fasting glycemia and lowered the higher expression of key factors involved in the fatty acid catabolism observed in the liver of n-3/-mice, without lessening steatosis. Conclusions the changes in the gut microbiota composition induced by FOS are different depending on the type of diet. We show that FOS may promote lactobacilli and counteract the catabolic status induced by n-3 PUFA depletion in mice, thereby contributing to restore efficient fat storage.",0

The in vitro activity of temocillin was studied using 932 recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci, and its activity was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Temocillin was active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with narrow ranges of MICs and MIC90 values (less than or equal to 8 mg/L) for all isolates except Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter species. Moreover, the compound was active against 46 multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae strains. The drug was also strongly active against Haemophilus influenzae, with beta-lactamase-producing strains being as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. Temocillin showed no useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter or Gram-positive cocci, and had only discrete activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group. In general, temocillin displayed the same spectrum of activity against Enterobacteriaceae as third generation cephalosporins, but with a substantially lower intrinsic activity.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10641969509087061,Central Monoamine Systems and New Antihypertensive Agents,"This review describes the relationship between central monoamine pathways and centrally acting antihypertensive agents. By using antagonists with affinity for alpha 2-adrenoceptors and also imidazoline receptors we have found that the first generation agents clonidine and alpha-methyldopa activate alpha 2-adrenoceptors while the newer second generation antihypertensive agents rilmenidine and moxonidine activate imidazoline receptors. Despite the difference in receptors activated, the hypotension produced by central administration of all agents was attenuated after chemical lesioning of the brainstem noradrenergic or serotonergic pathways suggesting a similar dependence on central monoamine pathways. Since the acute 6-hydroxydopamine-induced release of noradrenaline in the brainstem produces hypotension it suggests that these agents normally mimic brainstem noradrenergic function. By contrast the pressor response shortly following 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine suggests serotonergic neurones in the brainstem are pressor and that part of the anti-hypertensive action of centrally acting antihypertensive agents is mediated by inhibition of bulbar serotonergic pathways. We suggest that the similar haemodynamic and baroreflex effects of the two generations of agents can be explained by the alpha 2-adrenoceptors and the imidazoline receptors being in series along the noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0732-8893(88)90025-9,Susceptibility testing of nocardia species for the clinical laboratory,"Not all patients are able to tolerate or show a favorable response to the treatment of choice for Nocardia, the sulfonamides. Many new drugs are available with good activity against N. asteroides, the most common pathogenic species, although susceptibility to these agents, including amikacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and the third generation cephalosporins, is variable. For these and other reasons, we recommend routine susceptibility testing of Nocardia. Disk diffusion testing on Mueller Hinton agar is the best currently available clinical method. A suggested control strain and tentative susceptible and resistant breakpoints for 12 antimicrobial agents are provided. This includes agents not previously evaluated, including cefotaxime, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline. The zones of inhibition were all larger than those currently used by the NCCLS for rapidly growing bacteria, and the disk breakpoints generally fit best with the MIC breakpoints used with the dilution susceptibility method (M7-T). A broth microdilution MIC method is described that showed good correlation with disk diffusion results, but need additional study. Because of limited experience in most laboratories with this species, reliance on a good reference laboratory for confirmatory susceptibility testing is recommended. Beta-lactamase testing is not helpful, as almost all Nocardia produce beta-lactamase, although many isolates retain susceptibility to selected beta-lactams.",0
https://doi.org/10.1094/phyto-97-6-0767,Mapping and Comparative Analysis of QTL for Crown Rust Resistance in an Italian × Perennial Ryegrass Population,"Crown rust (Puccinia coronata f. sp. lolli) is a serious fungal foliar disease of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), which are important forage and turf species. A number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for crown rust resistance previously were identified in perennial ryegrass under growth chamber or greenhouse conditions. In this study, we conducted a QTL mapping for crown rust resistance in a three-generation Italian × perennial ryegrass interspecific population under natural field conditions at two locations over 2 years. Through a comparative mapping analysis, we also investigated the syntenic relationships of previously known crown rust resistance genes in other ryegrass germplasms and oat, and genetic linkage between crown rust resistance QTL and three lignin genes: LpOMT1, LpCAD2, and LpCCR1. The interspecific mapping population of 156 progeny was developed from a cross between two Italian × perennial ryegrass hybrids, MFA and MFB. Because highly susceptible reactions to crown rust were observed from all perennial ryegrass clones, including two grandparental clones and eight clones from different pedigrees tested in this study, two grandparent clones from Italian ryegrass cv. Floregon appeared to be a source of the resistance. Two QTL on linkage groups (LGs) 2 and 7 in the resistant parent MFA map were detected consistently regardless of year and location. The others, specific to year and location, were located on LGs 3 and 6 in the susceptible parent MFB map. The QTL on LG2 was likely to correspond to those previously reported in three unrelated perennial ryegrass mapping populations; however, the other QTL on LGs 3, 6, and 7 were not. The QTL on LG7 was closely located in the syntenic genomic region where genes Pca cluster, Pcq2, Pc38, and Prq1b resistant to crown rust (P. coronata f. sp. avenae) in oat (Avena sativa L.) were previously identified. Similarly, the QTL on LG3 was found in a syntenic region with oat genes resistant to crown rust isolates PC54 and PC59. This indicates that the ortholoci for resistance genes to different formae speciales of crown rust might be present between two distantly related grass species, ryegrass and oat. In addition, we mapped four restriction fragment length polymorphism loci for three key ryegrass lignin genes encoding caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and cinnamoyl CoA-reductase on LG7. These loci were within a range of 8 to 17 centimorgans from the QTL on LG7, suggesting no tight linkage between them. The putative ortholoci for those lignin biosynthesis genes were identified on segments of rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosomes 6 and 8, which are the counterparts of ryegrass LG7. Results from the current study facilitate understanding of crown rust resistance and its relationship with lignin biosynthesis, and also will benefit ryegrass breeders for improving crown rust resistance through marker-assisted selection.",0
,Variations in the length of poly-C and poly-T tracts in intron 3 of the human ferrochelatase gene.,"The third intron of human ferrochelatase (FECH) gene contains according to NCBI, a poly-C (11) and a poly-T (24) tracts which are located approximately 900 bp upstream from the known splice modulating SNP IVS3-48 c/t. Ferrochelatase catalyses the last step in heme biosynthesis and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the hereditary disorder of erythropoietic protopoprhyria (EPP). During the course of mutation analysis in the FECH gene among EPP patients, we observed variations in the length of the poly-C and poly-T tracts. To study these variations, we analyzed a total of 54 individuals of Swiss and Israeli origins. Among them, 37 were control subjects (23 individuals with the genotype t/t and 14 with the genotype c/t), 10 were unrelated EPP patients (genotype c/M) and 7 were unrelated asymptomatic mutation carriers (genotype t/M). The length of poly-C tract varied from 10 to 16, that of poly-T tract from 22 to 24 in the study cohort. Statistic analysis showed that the low-expressed FECH allele (IVS3-48c) is associated with poly-C12, C13 and C15 and poly-T22. In addition, the segregation of poly-C and poly-T tracts was studied in two Israeli EPP families. Instabilities, as seen by both insertion and deletion of one nucleotide between two generations, were observed only in the poly-T tract. The function of the poly-C and poly-T tracts are yet to be explored.",0

Exons 5 and 7 of the p53 gene were not mutated under both chronic and transgenerational exposure, but, p53 protein response was altered. In P mice, p53 protein was initially upregulated in comparison to age-matched controls, reaching 2.5 folds in the liver after 6 weeks of exposure. Subsequently, p53 protein declined to control level after 16 weeks, with concomitant preneoplastic nodulation of the liver. After 24 weeks, p53 protein was below control level, and preneoplastic nodules were well-developed. The level of p53 protein in transgenerationally exposed mice remained invariant in comparison to age-matched controls. Liver nodulation was significantly advanced, developing in F1 mice after 8 weeks, F2 mice after 6 weeks and F3 mice after 4 weeks of exposure. Anomalies not observed in P mice, developed in transgenerationally exposed mice, albeit, non-significantly. Thus, AEBN exposure enhanced transgeneration transmission of carcinogenic risk.",1

In order to establish adequate protocols for intervention and control in infected mother-neonate pairs in endemic zones of Chagas disease, we present partial results (2005-2008) of a pilot project which is being carried out in the Province of Choapa, IV Region, Chile, whose objectives are: determine the current prevalence of the disease in pregnant women, estimate the incidence of vertical transmission of T. cruzi to newborns, determine the lineages of the parasite present in mothers who do and do not transmit the disease, determine the prevalence of Chagas disease in maternal grandmothers of neonates and study placental histopathology. Preliminary results indicated that in this study period, 3.7% of the women who gave birth in the Province have Chagas disease and 2.5% of their newborns were infected. The most frequent T. cruzi genotypes found in mothers studied during pregnancy were TCI and TCIId, either alone or in mixed infections. A high percentage (74.3%) of the grandmothers studied was infected with the parasite. In 29 placentas from mothers with Chagas disease we observed edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposits and slight lymphoplasmocyte infiltration. In three placentas we found erythroblastosis and in one of them amastigote forms of T. cruzi; this was one of the cases of congenital infection. The evaluation of the diagnostic and control protocols generated will allow us to determine if it has been possible to modify the natural history of vertical transmission of T. cruzi in Chile.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-012-2466-5,Surgical Technique: Second-generation Bone Marrow Stimulation via Surgical Dislocation to Treat Hip Cartilage Lesions,"Compared to knees, hips have more bony constraint and soft tissue coverage. Thus, repair of focal cartilage defects in hips requires more invasive and technically complex surgeries than simple arthroscopy or arthrotomy. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) is a second-generation bone marrow stimulation technique. Improvement in Tegner, Lysholm, International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS), and Cincinnati scores has been reported at 1 and 2 years after AMIC in knees. AMIC is potentially useful to repair defects in hips, but it is unknown whether it relieves symptoms or results in a durable construct.A surgical hip dislocation is used to access the defect. This is débrided to stable cartilage shoulders, necrotic bone is removed, and the lesion base is drilled. Autogenous bone graft is used for lesions with bony defects to create a level surface. Fibrin gel and a collagen membrane are placed to stabilize the superclot for fibrocartilage formation.We treated six patients with AMIC in the hip between 2009 and 2010. We obtained Oxford Hip and UCLA Activity Scores. Repair quality was assessed on 6-month postoperative MRI using the modified magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) system. Minimum 1-year followup data were available for four patients (range, 1-2.5 years).Postoperative Oxford Hip Scores ranged from 13 to 17, UCLA Activity Scores ranged from 5 to 10, and MOCART scores ranged from 55 to 75. No complications occurred.We describe AMIC in the hip. Although these patients had pain relief and improved function, long-term followup is necessary to assess the duration of improvement, durability of repair, and potential for arthrosis.Level IV, therapeutic study.

,The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity in patients undergoing haemodialysis or with malignant disease.,"We studied the occurrence of anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies in patients with malignant disease (53), in patients undergoing haemodialysis (56), and in blood donors (204) as healthy population controls. The study was carried out using the second-generation EIA test. Anti-HCV positivity was 23.2% in haemodialysis (HD) patients, 0.5% in blood donors, and 0% of the patients with malignant disease (MD). There was no association between anti-HCV positivity and the results of AST, ALT and HBsAg tests in patients and controls. But there was significant association of blood transfusion frequency and duration of HD with anti-HCV positivity in patients undergoing HD, and conversely an absence of this association in patients with MD. However, two of the anti-HCV-positive HD patients did not have any blood transfusion history. One HCV-positive blood donor had a history of surgical operation. Nosocomial transmission of HCV infection has replaced blood transfusion as the main risk factor in HD patients, and preventive measures should be performed in this direction to control infection.",0

https://doi.org/10.2190/0m5q-7byx-44nr-m1gg,Silences: Helping Elderly Holocaust Victims Deal with the Past,"Persons who have faced severe crises such as the Holocaust in Nazi Germany confront painful memories, guilt, and the perceived irrationality of their own survival, which represses thoughts and memories. There is no language to share the dark and difficult years of the past. Silence is their only voice of expression. In later life, when friends are gone, the need to share with others becomes urgent; to bear witness is vital. Helping persons share these experiences is no easy task. To engage the elderly with reminiscences, memory, bereavement, and the working through of guilt provide unusual challenges for the helping professions. Significant family events are also important opportunities for sharing the past. It is the children and grandchildren's desire to know that also prompts the sharing of past horrors and future hopes. They often enable the deepest silences to be shared and it is the elderly that often welcome this opportunity. Being sensitive to these intergenerational dynamics are important in helping elderly Holocaust victims deal with their past.",0
https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01467-10,Developmental Penalties Associated with Inducible Tolerance in <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> to Insecticidal Toxins from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>,"ABSTRACT Exposure of insect larvae to sublethal concentrations of crystal toxins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt toxins) causes the induction of immune and metabolic responses that can be transmitted to offspring by epigenetic inheritance mechanisms. Given that the elevated immune status carries significant developmental penalties, we wanted to establish the relationships between immune induction, tolerance to the toxin and developmental penalties. A laboratory culture of Helicoverpa armigera was induced by a sublethal bacterial suspension containing crystal toxin Cry1Ac in one generation and maintained in the presence of toxin, acquiring significant levels of tolerance to the toxin within 12 generations of continuous exposure. Comparing tolerant and susceptible insects, we show that the induction of larval immune response and the coincident alteration of development-related metabolic activities by elicitors in the larval gut (larval induction) differs from the elevated immune status transmitted by epigenetic mechanisms (embryonic induction). Because the damaging effects of larval induction processes are higher compared to embryonic induction, it is likely that overall developmental penalties depend on the relative contribution of the two induction processes. When insects are kept with the same amount of toxin in the diet for subsequent generations, the embryonic induction process increases its contribution compared to the larval induction, resulting in reduced overall developmental penalty, while tolerance to the toxin is maintained.",0

Of these, 87 received leflunomide after MTX had failed as a first line DMARD, and 8 received leflunomide as a first line DMARD. 50 patients had another first line therapy. Of the first line leflunomide patients 3 (38%) were still on leflunomide at the last visit, as compared to 7 of the 44 patients (16%) who were switched from MTX to leflunomide, and 0 of the 27 patients in whom leflunomide was added to MTX (p&lt;0.01 vs 1st line leflunomide). For leflunomide monotherapy, 29% and 19% were still on the drug after 24 and 48 months, respectively, as compared to 14 and 0% under the combination with MTX. Of all patients who started leflunomide, remission (at least low disease activity) as per CDAI (≤2.8 (≤10)) was reached by 23% (57%) 3 months, 20% (40%) 6 months, and 16% (34%) one year after initiating leflunomide monotherapy, with corresponding percentages of patients of 39% switched to other approaches at six months and of 60% switched at one year. Under the combination of leflunomide and MTX, remission (at least low disease activity) was seen in 18% (53%) at 3 months, 20% (37%) at 6 months, and 8% (20%) at one year, and 55% and 71% had switched to other modes of action at six months and one year, respectively. Gastrointestinal and mucocutaneous adverse events and hypertension were common, and 4 our patients experienced serious bacterial infections. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Leflunomide constitutes a longer term option for a subgroup of RA patients with contraindications to MTX or after MTX failure. After one year, leflunomide had led to sustained acceptable disease control in approximately one third of the patients, but only in one in five under leflunomide combined with MTX. These results are supportive of the EULAR recommendations that patients should be switched to a second conventional DMARD in the absence of predictors of bad outcome only. If leflunomide is initiated, the patients need to be followed closely for potential secondary loss of efficacy. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",0

This epigenetic transgenerational phenomenon will be discussed with respect to adult-onset germline disease (e.g. testicular cancer). A thorough literature review is not provided, rather a perspective is provided on how this epigenetic transgenerational toxicology should be considered in germ cell disease and testicular cancer.",1

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers and HLA tissue types were analysed in the three generations of the expanded family of 35. Twenty-one of the three generations were positive for one or more serum HBV markers, including six of the 18 children. Intrafamilial spread of HBV was seen in four of the eight families. Tissue types did not correlate with HBV status. The two propositi of the four with HCC studied and four of six siblings were positive for HBsAg: both propositi had identical HLA haplotypes, including Bw46/DRw9. Evidence is as yet insufficient that this haplotype may represent a disease susceptibility gene for HCC. Other family members at risk will be those positive for HBsAg and/or anti HBC, but those with Bw46/DRw9 will be monitored with special interest.",0
,Shear bond strength of seventh generation bonding agents on dentin of primary teeth--an in vitro study.,"This controlled, randomized, in vitro study evaluated the shear bond strength of several seventh generation bonding agents on the dentin of primary teeth. Six different adhesives were used: Xeno IV, Clearfil S3 Bond, Adper Prompt-L-Pop, AdheSE One, Bond Force, and Optibond (control). Ninety primary teeth were prepared by wet grinding with a 320-grit silicon carbide paper on a polishing wheel running at 110 RPM. After 24 hours of storage in water, shear bond strengths of each group were determined. The mean shear bond strength of the tested adhesive systems to primary dentin was 12.27 MPa. One-way ANOVA testing showed a statistically significant difference between adhesive products (P < 0.001). Tukey HSD post hoc tests were used to assess which means were significantly different from one another. There was no statistically significant difference between the fifth generation adhesive system (Optibond) and the two seventh generation systems (Xeno IV and Bond Force), with Optibond exhibiting a lower mean shear bond strength compared to Bond Force. Within the limitations of this study, there is a significant difference between seventh generation bonding materials. Bond Force and Optibond appear to exhibit higher shear bond strengths than the other products.",0

In transgenesis, it is a prerequisite for the production of subsequent generations and a crucial parameter for evaluating efficiency. Yet, ongoing success in mosquito vector transformation is being severely affected by low embryo survivability. In the prospect of overcoming this impediment, we investigated the darkening/hardening process of the chorion, the effects of some parameters required for transgenesis on hatch success, and erratic hatching in Aedes albopictus, a species that has not yet been targeted for transformation. The eggs from this species, when placed in a moistened environment while whitish, become dark and yet still remain soft approximately 2 h 10 min postoviposition. Those reared in a high moisture environment hatched at a high rate compared with their counterparts submitted to a drier environment. Submission of eggs to p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidino-benzoate, a substance known to delay the darkening/delay process, resulted in a hatch rate lower than that from eggs soaked in distilled water, which suggests a negative impact on viability. Heat-shock treatment did not taint embryo viability. Overall, eggs displayed a tolerance to an hour of heat shock at 39 degrees C but still hatched at a considerable rate after a 1 hr exposure to 42 degrees C. Hatching was erratic, with a high rate of hatching on the initial flooding and lower rates of hatching on subsequent floodings, all of which resulted cumulatively in considerable hatch success. Our results should serve as a useful reference for the production of both transgenic and laboratory strains of floodwater Aedes mosquitoes.",0
,Early crop root destruction for management of tobacco cyst nematodes.,"Prompt tillage after crop harvest was investigated as a cultural control for the tobacco cyst nematode, Globodera tabacum tabacum, on stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco. Stalk stumps and roots remaining after harvest were destroyed by tilling immediately or from 2 to 6 wk after harvest in field experiments over 4 yr. Cyst nematode Pf/Pi ratios ranged from 0.65 to 1.62 when plants were tilled immediately after harvest and 1.13 to 5.88 when tillage was delayed. Nematode population development was monitored by inoculating plants in pots placed in fields with J2 in eggs and sampling over time (8 to 18 wk). Three generations per year were observed, and G. t. tabacum generation time was as short as 6 wk for each generation. Destroying stalks and root systems remaining after harvesting stalk-cut broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco removes the host to preclude development of nematodes at the end of the second and entire third generation. Early tillage resulted in consistently lower tobacco cyst nematode populations than allowing viable roots to remain in fields for an additional 8 to 18 wk. This management tactic reduces the need for nematicide application to slow nematode population increases over time and can reduce losses due to infection by G. t. tabacum.",0
,Impact of education in the knowledge and practices of rural mothers and key family members on diarrhoea and its treatment at home.,"Ready-made sachets of oral rehydration solution for the treatment of diarrhea are constantly in short supply in developing countries. Thus, the effective use of home-made salt-sugar solution (SSS) by trained persons in the community is considered crucial. An education material for such a training was prepared based on the findings of beliefs and practices regarding diarrhea in children, obtained from 116 randomly selected mothers or key family members in the Barain Village of Chiraigaon block, Varanasi, India. In the present study, the material was used to train 66 mothers or key family members (key persons) in a joint family to identify diarrhea, signs of dehydration, prepare SSS at home, use it to rehydrate their sick children and continue normal diet throughout the diarrhea period. A control sample comprising 50 matched mothers or key persons were taken in the study who did not get the education. An evaluation was done 6 weeks after the educational sessions by interviewing the 116 persons (test 66; control 50), using the same pre-scored proforma blanks which were used during the initial survey. The mean pre-and post-education scores in the knowledge of mothers and key persons regarding various aspects of diarrhea showed that there was a significant post-education gain in knowledge in both the groups in all aspects of diarrhea, except the knowledge of the beneficial effect of continuing normal food during diarrhea. An almost identical result was seen when both the groups were combined and assessed. Regarding various practices during diarrhea, the data showed that the pre- and post-education practices regarding breast-feeding and food- and fluid-restriction did not vary significantly. People of the area knew from beforehand about the beneficial effect of breast-feeding and not restricting food and fluid during diarrhea. However, there was a significant rise in the practice of using home-made SSS both among the trained and untrained groups (t=3.5,p0.01; t=2.19, p0.05). Among the trained groups, the practice was adopted significantly more among mothers, but not among the key persons, such as grandmothers. An inference is drawn with caution that this type of education may be a powerful tool to train mothers to identify acute dehydrating diarrhea in their children and to treat them orally at home by preparing SSS.

https://doi.org/10.2108/zsj.29.49,Inheritance Patterns of Lateral Dimorphism Examined through Breeding Experiments in Tanganyikan Cichlid (<i>Julidochromis transcriptus</i>) and Japanese Medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>),"The asymmetry of mouth morphology, in which the mouth opens either leftward or rightward, is a unique example of antisymmetry that is widely found in fishes, such as Tanganyikan scale-eating cichlids, herbivorous cichlids, and the Japanese freshwater goby. This dimorphism is thought to be heritable in a Mendelian manner similar to that of the dominance of the lefty allele over righty, with homozygotes of lefty alleles being absent. This study aims to reveal whether this trait is inherited in the same Mendelian manner in fishes other than those examined to date, and whether the absence of the dominant homozygote is due to a lethal effect. We conducted F1 and F2 breeding experiments using the Tanganyikan cichlid Julidochromis transcriptus and Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes. For both J. transcriptus and O. latipes, the F1 generations produced by incrossing lefty parents showed a lefty:righty ratio of 2:1, whereas incrosses of righties produced only righty offspring. Test crosses between lefty and righty produced a 1:1 ratio of lefty and righty offspring. These results are consistent with the inheritance model in which righty is homozygous for a recessive righty allele and lefty is heterozygous for dominant lefty and recessive righty alleles, in agreement with previous observations. The F2 test cross also confirmed this pattern. Furthermore, no lethal effects on hatchability of O. latipes were detected, refuting the suggestion that the dominant homozygote is embryonic lethal. We conclude that mouth laterality is inherited in the same Mendelian manner in these two species, similar to that other fish species studied previously. However, the reason for absence of the dominant homozygote remains unclear.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313x.1995.8060827.x,The S locus receptor kinase gene encodes a soluble glycoprotein corresponding to the SRK extracellular domain in Brassica oleracea,"Self-incompatibility in Brassica is controlled by the S locus which contains at least two genes. SLG encodes a secreted S locus glycoprotein whilst SRK encodes a putative S locus receptor kinase which consists of three domains: an extracellular domain sharing extensive sequence identity with SLG, transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain exhibiting a serine/threonine protein kinase activity. Here, the existence of truncated forms of the SRK protein corresponding to the extracellular domain of the putative receptor is reported. These proteins were detected by an antibody which recognizes the N-terminus of SRK3 and, in an F2 progeny segregating for the S3 haplotype, were only expressed in plants possessing the S3 haplotype. The truncated SRK proteins were expressed specifically in stigmas but, unlike the membrane-spanning SRK3 protein, were soluble and occurred as four different glycoforms sharing the same amino acid backbone as shown by deglycosylation experiments. Several SRK3 transcripts that may code for these truncated SRK3 proteins have been identified by RACE PCR, stigma cDNA library screening and RNA blot analysis. These transcripts are apparently generated by a combination of alternative splicing and the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The existence of truncated forms of the S locus receptor kinase highlights some similarities between plant and animal receptor kinases. In animals, soluble extracellular domains of receptors have been described and, in some cases, have been shown to play a role in the modulation of signal transduction. By analogy, the soluble, truncated SRK proteins may play a similar role in the self-incompatibility response.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-4269-2-4,Ethno-diversity within current ethno-pharmacology as part of Israeli traditional medicine – A review,"Abstract The Holy Land has absorbed millions of immigrants in recent centuries: Jews from East and West, Druze, Circassians, Muslim and Christian Arabs. The land is unique and diverse in geographical location and ethnic groups, and also in its cultural characteristics, including traditional medicine and use of materia medica . However, these traditions have waned over the years. The young state of Israel adopted a ""melting pot"" approach to fashion Jews from all over the world into Israelis. The traditional medicine and materia medica of different ethnic groups (Yemenite, Iranian, and Iraqi Jews) are reviewed in this paper, as well as the ethno-botanical survey (first conducted in the 1980s, covering Bedouins, Druze, Circassians, and Muslim and Christian Arabs), and the matching ethno-pharmacological survey (conducted in the late 1990s) covering the medicines sold in stores. Present-day healers are usually not young and are believed to be the end of the chain of traditional medical knowledge. The ethno-diversity of Israel is becoming blurred; modernity prevails, and ethnic characteristics are fading. The characteristic lines of traditional medicine and materia medica have hardly lasted three generations. A salient former dividing line between ethnic groups, namely their use of different medicinal substances, paradoxically becomes a bridge for conservative users of all groups and religions. Shops selling these substances have become centers for ""nostalgia"" and preserving the oriental heritage, traditional medicine, and medicinal substances!",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355838202029941,Evolutionary dynamics and population control during in vitro selection and amplification with multiple targets,"Iterative cycles of in vitro selection and amplification allow rare functional nucleic acid molecules, aptamers, to be isolated from large sequence pools. Here we present an analysis of the progression of a selection experiment that simultaneously yielded two families of RNA aptamers against two disparate targets: the intended target protein (B52/SRp55) and the partitioning matrix. We tracked the sequence abundance and binding activity to reveal the enrichment of the aptamers through successive generations of selected pools. The two aptamer families showed distinct trajectories of evolution, as did members within a single family. We also developed a method to control the relative abundance of an aptamer family in selected pools. This method, involving specific ribonuclease digestion, can be used to reduce the background selection for aptamers that bind the matrix. Additionally, it can be used to isolate a full spectrum of aptamers in a sequential and exhaustive manner for all the different targets in a mixture.",0
https://doi.org/10.2307/2133764,Three Generations of Parents,"The 1906-1910 cohort of women in the United States had a completed fertility average of 2.3 children, a net reproduction rate 13% below replacement level. 44% of these women had no children or only 1. This low fertility is not attributed to effects of the Depression. Lowering in fertility began in the 1920's and among the better educated classes of the population. The reduction in fertility was achieved with ineffective methods of birth control and, it is believed, widespread use of illegal abortion. The 1931-1935 cohorts had a completed family size of 3.2 children, the highest fertility level since the 1881-1885 cohorts. This high fertility is due largely to 2-4 children families. Fertility rose most among college educated women, and among middle- and upper class women. Reasons for the sharp increase in fertility is the small numbers of young people entering the job market at that time and the preponderance of early childbearing. It is predicted that fertility of the 1956-1960 cohort will be lower than that of the 1931-1935 cohort. It will probably not reach the low levels of the 1906-1910 cohort because there is a widespread desire for at least 1 child. The rate for 3rd and higher birth orders is falling to its lowest level ever. To achieve population replacement level in the United States, effective contraception and liberal provision for abortion are necessary. Social changes which emphasize the small family norm are also necessary.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057(88)90011-1,Classical genetic analysis of GABA-related seizures,"Differences in resistance to 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MP)-induced seizures exist between DBA/2Ibg and C57BL/6Ibg inbred strains of mice; C57BL/6Ibg mice are more resistant to MP-induced seizures. To determine the mode of inheritance for seizure resistance, a classical genetic analysis was conducted using these two parental strains, their F1, F2, and backcross generations. Latencies to seizure onset and tonus after intraperitoneal (IP) injections of MP (25-40 mg/kg) were quantified. For all populations mean latencies to onset and tonus decreased in a dose dependent manner with the hybrid generations exhibiting a seizure resistant phenotype resembling the C57BL/6Ibg strain. In general, female mice were less resistant to MP-induced seizures than males; however, a significant degree of resistance was retained by the C57BL/6Ibg females and their female progeny. A quantitative assessment of the pattern of inheritance for seizure resistance using a weighted least-squares regression approach indicated that an additive-dominance model explained latency to seizure onset data at 25, 35 and 40 mg/kg. However, at 30 mg/kg, the model required the addition of an epistatic parameter to best describe mean scores at this dose. The results of these analyses suggest that resistance to MP-induced seizures is transmitted in a dominant manner.",0

In the present study, gilts were injected intra-muscularly at day 85 of gestation with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5 mg of the HV-GHRH-expressing plasmid and were then electroporated. Piglets were weighed and bled periodically from birth to 100 kg. Piglets from gilts treated with 1 and 5 mg of HV-GHRH plasmid were larger at birth and weaning compared with controls. These two groups reached 100 kg 9 days earlier than the other groups. GHRH levels were increased at birth in piglets from treated gilts. IGF-I levels were significantly increased in the 5-mg group beginning at 21 days of age compared with controls. Pituitaries from the 5-mg group contained a significantly increased number of somatotrophs and lactotrophs from birth to 100 kg. This study confirms that enhanced maternal GHRH production results in intergenerational growth augmentation and that the magnitude of the response is dose dependent. The similarity of the response across species suggests that the effect is likely exerted as a fundamental component of gestational and developmental physiology.",0

https://doi.org/10.2165/0128071-200809060-00003,Topical Retinoids in Acne Vulgaris,"Topical retinoids represent a mainstay of acne treatment because they expel mature comedones, reduce microcomedone formation, and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The first-generation retinoid tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) and the synthetic third-generation polyaromatics adapalene and tazarotene are approved for acne treatment by the US FDA, whereas topical tretinoin, isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid), and adapalene are accredited in Canada and Europe. Topical retinoids have a favorable safety profile distinct from the toxicity of their systemic counterparts. Local adverse effects, including erythema, dryness, itching, and stinging, occur frequently during the early treatment phase. Their impact varies with the vehicle formation, skin type, frequency and mode of application, use of moisturizers, and environmental factors such as sun exposure or temperature. The broad anti-acne activity and safety profile of topical retinoids justifies their use as first-line treatment in most types of non-inflammatory and inflammatory acne. They are also suitable as long-term medications, with no risk of inducing bacterial resistance, for maintenance of remission after cessation of initial combination therapy.",0

https://doi.org/10.2174/092986712803251557,Alkyl Hydroxybenzoic Acid Derivatives that Inhibit HIV-1 Protease Dimerization,"The therapeutic potential of gallic acid and its derivatives as anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral agents is well known. We have examined the mechanism by which natural gallic acid and newly synthesized gallic acid alkyl esters and related protocatechuic acid alkyl esters inhibit HIV-1 protease to compare the influence of the aromatic ring substitutions on inhibition. We used Zhang-Poorman’s kinetic analysis and fluorescent probe binding to demonstrate that several gallic and protecatechuic acid alkyl esters inhibited HIV-1 protease by preventing the dimerization of this obligate homodimeric aspartic protease rather than targeting the active site. The tri-hydroxy substituted benzoic moiety in gallates was more favorable than the di-substituted one in protocatechuates. In both series, the type of inhibition, its mechanism and the inhibitory efficiency dramatically depended on the length of the alkyl chain: no inhibition with alkyl chains less than 8 carbon atoms long. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the kinetic data and propose that gallic esters are intercalated between the two N- and C-monomer ends. They complete the β-sheet and disrupt the dimeric enzyme. The best gallic ester (14 carbon atoms, Kid of 320 nM) also inhibited the multi-mutated protease MDR-HM. These results will aid the rational design of future generations of non-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 protease dimerization that inhibit multi-mutated proteases. Finally, our work suggests the wide use of gallic and protocatechuic alkyl esters to dissociate intermolecular β-sheets involved in protein-protein interactions.",0

Exposure to stress and its glucocorticoid hormone mediators may underpin this association. In humans and in animal models, prenatal stress, excess exogenous glucocorticoids or inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2; the placental barrier to maternal glucocorticoids) reduces birth weight and causes hyperglycemia, hypertension, increased HPA axis reactivity, and increased anxiety-related behaviour. Molecular mechanisms that underlie the 'developmental programming' effects of excess glucocorticoids/prenatal stress include epigenetic changes in target gene promoters. In the case of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), this alters tissue-specific GR expression levels, which has persistent and profound effects on glucocorticoid signalling in certain tissues (e.g. brain, liver, and adipose). Crucially, changes in gene expression persist long after the initial challenge, predisposing the individual to disease in later life. Intriguingly, the effects of a challenged pregnancy appear to be transmitted possibly to one or two subsequent generations, suggesting that these epigenetic effects persist.",1

The women from group A received a contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinylestradiol/75 microg gestodene. The women from group B received a contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradio l/75 microg gestodene. At the beginning and again at the end of the study, the following values were determined: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastic time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (F), Factor VII (FVII), Factor X (FX), plasminogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), D-dimers, protein C (Pr C), total Protein S (TPr S), antithrombin III (AT III) and heparin Cofactor II (HC II).We did not find any statistically significant differences in the global tests of hemostasis (PT, aPTT, TT) in either group compared with the baseline values. At the end of the study there was an increase in the levels of fibrinogen, FX, PrC and H II, and also diminution of t-PA in both groups in comparison with the baseline values. At the end of the study the activity of FVII, alpha2-antiplasmin and AT III was elevated only in group B. Although certain alterations in hemostasis parameters were observed, all of them were within the reference range. We did not observe or suspect any cases of vascular, thrombotic or other incidence in the observed groups of 840 cycles of hormonal contraception over the 12-month period.There is an increase in both procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity when using low-dose gestodene containing monophasic oral contraceptives. This can be interpreted as a shift to a higher equilibrium. There is no need for screening for thrombofilia in healthy, non-obese, non-smoking Bulgarian females, aged between 18 to 35 years, without a personal or family history of thrombotic diseases, before starting on third generation oral contraceptive with gestodene.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0b013e32833c57a8,Opioid use in chronic noncancer pain: guidelines revisited,"The treatment of chronic noncancer pain with opioids is controversial. This review aims to find answers to three questions patients and physicians might have: how much (pain relief can be expected), how long (will pain relief be sustained) and how bad (are side-effects)? To this end, we reviewed the second generation of clinical guidelines on this topic. These are based on a significantly higher number of randomized controlled trials than former ones and, therefore, allow evidence-based statements.Six guidelines have been launched recently to improve care and safety when treating chronic noncancer pain with opioids. The evidence base for long-term administration of opioids is weak, mostly due to methodological flaws in the available studies and because opioids have no superior effects compared with other analgesics. The maximum pain relief attributable to opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration for up to 3 months is 8-12 out of 100 units. It is doubtful that this is clinically important for patients with chronic noncancer pain. Even selected 'responders' from previous randomized controlled trials do not report noticeable pain relief. The small effect-size differences between the classes of analgesic drugs do not provide a basis for differential therapeutic decisions.Many guideline panels concentrate their recommendations solely on safety of opioid analgesics and patients are usually not informed about the (low) degree of pain relief to be expected. This makes adherence of patients unlikely. Beyond that, multimodal treatment of chronic noncancer pain should become the center of attention.",0

In January 1999, fever and night sweats appeared with laboratory evidence for EBV infection, and acute swelling of lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly developed in May 1999. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of DLBCL. Sequence analysis of the complementarity-determining region (CDR)-III of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene demonstrated clonal identity between the initial MCL and the subsequent DLBCL. Immunohistochemistry revealed that cyclin D1, CD5, and CD20 were expressed in the MCL but lost in the DLBCL cells, and EBER-ISH confirmed that EBV infection was absent in the former but present in the latter. Southern hybridization with the EBV terminal repeat probe showed a clear monoclonal pattern in the DLBCL specimen. All these results suggest that EBV infection may have been the molecular event that caused transformation of MCL cell(s) to DLBCL in this case. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-documented case of EBV-associated transformation of MCL.",0

To date, no published human studies have evaluated the relation between prenatal cocaine exposure and postnatal adolescent cocaine use. Human studies of prenatal cocaine-exposed children have also noted an increase in behaviors previously associated with substance use/abuse in teens and young adults, specifically childhood and teen externalizing behaviors, impulsivity, and attention problems. Despite these findings, human research has not addressed prior prenatal exposure as a potential predictor of teen drug use behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relations between prenatal cocaine exposure and teen cocaine use in a prospective longitudinal cohort (n = 316) that permitted extensive control for child, parent and community risk factors. Logistic regression analyses and Structural Equation Modeling revealed that both prenatal exposure and postnatal parent/caregiver cocaine use were uniquely related to teen use of cocaine at age 14 years. Teen cocaine use was also directly predicted by teen community violence exposure and caregiver negativity, and was indirectly related to teen community drug exposure. These data provide further evidence of the importance of prenatal exposure, family and community factors in the intergenerational transmission of teen/young adult substance abuse/use.",0
,"Evaluation of secondary poisoning of difethialone, a new second-generation anticoagulant rodenticide to barn owl, Tyto alba Hartert under captivity.","Secondary toxcity of difethialone to Barn owl (Tyto alba) has been investigated. Difethialone was fed to owls for successive periods of 1 (phase 1), 3 (phase 2) and 6 (phase 3) days via-rodenticide dosed rats. The owls survived after the treament of rodenticide on phase 1 and phase 2 experiments but they died during phase 3 experiment. The results suggest that the difethialone could cause more secondary toxicity to owls.",0

The difference between the extent of Contrada endogamy expected at random and observed in the parents' generation does not seem to affect the genetic structure of the present population. However, the bulk of marriage migration (more than 70%) is short range, with people coming from Tuscany. There is no statistical difference in marital migration between males and females.",0

https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211827110,Great majority of recombination events in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are gene conversion events,"The evolutionary importance of meiosis may not solely be associated with allelic shuffling caused by crossing-over but also have to do with its more immediate effects such as gene conversion. Although estimates of the crossing-over rate are often well resolved, the gene conversion rate is much less clear. In Arabidopsis , for example, next-generation sequencing approaches suggest that the two rates are about the same, which contrasts with indirect measures, these suggesting an excess of gene conversion. Here, we provide analysis of this problem by sequencing 40 F 2 Arabidopsis plants and their parents. Small gene conversion tracts, with biased gene conversion content, represent over 90% (probably nearer 99%) of all recombination events. The rate of alteration of protein sequence caused by gene conversion is over 600 times that caused by mutation. Finally, our analysis reveals recombination hot spots and unexpectedly high recombination rates near centromeres. This may be responsible for the previously unexplained pattern of high genetic diversity near Arabidopsis centromeres.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/em.2850110311,Human mutagens: Evidence from paternal exposure?,"The importance of inherited mutations as a cause of human disease has been established clearly through examples of well-defined genetic anomalies, such as Down syndrome and retinoblastoma. Furthermore, it is suspected that environmental contaminants induce mutations resulting in increased risk for such defects in subsequent generations of persons exposed. The present lack of direct evidence for induced inherited genetic disorders in human beings hampers the development of risk estimation techniques for extrapolation from animal models. The most extensive prospective epidemiologic studies of inherited genetic effects have involved survivors of atomic bomb detonations and patients treated with cancer chemotherapy. In neither case has a significant elevation in inherited genetic effects or cancer been detected in the offspring of exposed individuals. Epidemiologic studies of subjects receiving chronic exposure may be confounded by the effect of maternal exposure during pregnancy. Consideration of only paternal exposure can minimize the confounding influence of teratogenicity, enhancing the resolving power of studies for inherited effects. Using this approach, retrospective (case-control) studies of childhood cancer patients have provided limited but suggestive evidence for inheritance of induced effects. Endpoints, such as congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion following paternal exposure, can also be considered as indicators of heritable mutagenic effects. For example, there is limited evidence suggesting that paternal exposure to anaesthetic gases may cause miscarriage and congenital abnormalities as a result of induced male germ cell mutations. By comparing male-exposure endpoints for which there are human data, as described above, with parallel or similar animal endpoints, such as dominant lethal, inherited cancer and ""male teratogenic"" effects, it is possible that suitable models for extrapolating to human risk can be developed. In order to establish a clearer relationship between induced mutation and genetic disease, the current surveillance systems should be expanded to include endpoints relevant to genetic study. The relaxation of regulations regarding access to census data could improve the chances of documenting such an association.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-007-9204-4,Universal risk factors for multifactorial diseases,"The risk for multifactorial diseases is determined by risk factors that frequently apply across disorders (universal risk factors). To investigate unresolved issues on etiology of and individual's susceptibility to multifactorial diseases, research focus should shift from single determinant-outcome relations to effect modification of universal risk factors. We present a model to investigate universal risk factors of multifactorial diseases, based on a single risk factor, a single outcome measure, and several effect modifiers. Outcome measures can be disease overriding, such as clustering of disease, frailty and quality of life. ""Life course epidemiology"" can be considered as a specific application of the proposed model, since risk factors and effect modifiers of multifactorial diseases typically have a chronic aspect. Risk factors are categorized into genetic, environmental, or complex factors, the latter resulting from interactions between (multiple) genetic and environmental factors (an example of a complex factor is overweight). The proposed research model of multifactorial diseases assumes that determinant-outcome relations differ between individuals because of modifiers, which can be divided into three categories. First, risk-factor modifiers that determine the effect of the determinant (such as factors that modify gene-expression in case of a genetic determinant). Second, outcome modifiers that determine the expression of the studied outcome (such as medication use). Third, generic modifiers that determine the susceptibility for multifactorial diseases (such as age). A study to assess disease risk during life requires phenotype and outcome measurements in multiple generations with a long-term follow up. Multiple generations will also enable to separate genetic and environmental factors. Traditionally, representative individuals (probands) and their first-degree relatives have been included in this type of research. We put forward that a three-generation design is the optimal approach to investigate multifactorial diseases. This design has statistical advantages (precision, multiple-informants, separation of non-genetic and genetic familial transmission, direct haplotype assessment, quantify genetic effects), enables unique possibilities to study social characteristics (socioeconomic mobility, partner preferences, between-generation similarities), and offers practical benefits (efficiency, lower non-response). LifeLines is a study based on these concepts. It will be carried out in a representative sample of 165,000 participants from the northern provinces of the Netherlands. LifeLines will contribute to the understanding of how universal risk factors are modified to influence the individual susceptibility to multifactorial diseases, not only at one stage of life but cumulatively over time: the lifeline.",0

The family tree of this patient is of particular interest because the deformity is known to have been present in 10 members of four generations, thus demonstrating the hereditary nature of the malformation. Because 10 of the 21 progeny were afflicted, the pedigree is interpreted as meaning that the disorder is the expression of an heterozygous, dominant trait. The patient was considerably benefited by the operation advocated by Faber and Towne for premature cranial synostosis, as modified by Ingraham.",0

One approach to confirming these effects and improving the mapping resolution is genetic chromosome dissection through a backcrossing programme. Analysis by interval mapping of the data generated is likely to provide additional power and resolution compared with treating data marker by marker. However, interval mapping approaches for such a programme are not well developed, especially where the founder lines were outbred. We explore alternative approaches to analysis using, as an example, data from chromosome 4 in an intercross between wild boar and Large White pigs where QTLs have been previously identified. A least squares interval mapping procedure was used to study growth rate and carcass traits in a subsequent second backcross generation (BC 2 ). This procedure requires the probability of inheriting a wild boar allele for each BC 2 animal for locations throughout the chromosome. Two methods for obtaining these probabilities were compared: stochastic or deterministic. The two methods gave similar probabilities for inheriting wild boar alleles and, hence, gave very similar results from the QTL analysis. The deterministic approach has the advantage of being much faster to run but requires specialized software. A QTL for fatness and for growth were confirmed and, in addition, a QTL for piglet growth from weaning at 5 weeks up to 7 weeks of age and another for carcass length were detected.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05549.x,NFB in the Mechanism of Ammonia-Induced Astrocyte Swelling in Culture,"Astrocyte swelling and brain edema are major neuropathological findings in the acute form of hepatic encephalopathy (fulminant hepatic failure), and substantial evidence supports the view that elevated brain ammonia level is an important etiological factor in this condition. Although the mechanism by which ammonia brings about astrocyte swelling remains to be determined, oxidative/nitrosative stress and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been considered as important elements in this process. One factor known to be activated by both oxidative stress and MAPKs is nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), a transcription factor that activates many genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). As the product of iNOS, nitric oxide (NO), is known to cause astrocyte swelling, we examined the potential involvement of NFkappaB in ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling. Western blot analysis of cultured astrocytes showed a significant increase in NFkappaB nuclear translocation (a measure of NFkappaB activation) from 12 h to 2 days after treatment with NH(4)Cl (5 mM). Cultures treated with anti-oxidants, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and vitamin E as well as the MAPKs inhibitors, SB239063 (an inhibitor of p38-MAPK) and SP600125 (an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase), significantly diminished NFkappaB activation by ammonia, supporting a role of oxidative stress and MAPKs in NFkappaB activation. The activation of NFkappaB was associated with increased iNOS protein expression and NO generation, and these changes were blocked by BAY 11-7082, an inhibitor of NFkappaB. Additionally, ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling was inhibited by the NFkappaB inhibitors, BAY 11-7082 and SN-50, thereby implicating NFkappaB in the mechanism of astrocyte swelling. Our studies indicate that cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia display NFkappaB activation, which is likely to be a consequence of oxidative stress and activation of MAPKs. NFkappaB activation appears to contribute to the mechanism of ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling, apparently through its up-regulation of iNOS protein expression and the subsequent generation of NO.",0

Diet-derived AGE (dAGE) are shown to contribute to end-organ toxicity attributed to diabetes. To assess the role of dAGE on type 1 diabetes, NOD mice were exposed to a high-AGE diet (H-AGE) and to a nutritionally similar diet with approximate fivefold-lower levels of N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and methylglyoxal-derivatives (MG) (L-AGE). Suppression of serum CML and MG in L-AGE-fed mice was marked by suppression of diabetes (H-AGE mice >94% vs. L-AGE mice 33% in founder [F](0), 14% in F(1), and 13% in F(2) offspring, P < 0.006) and by a delay in disease onset (4-month lag). Survival for L-AGE mice was 76 vs. 0% after 44 weeks of H-AGE mice. Reduced insulitis in L-AGE versus H-AGE mice (P < 0.01) was marked by GAD- and insulin-unresponsive pancreatic interleukin (IL)-4-positive CD4+ cells compared with the GAD- and insulin-responsive interferon (IFN)-gamma-positive T-cells from H-AGE mice (P < 0.005). Splenocytes from L-AGE mice consisted of GAD- and insulin-responsive IL-10-positive CD4+ cells compared with the IFN-gamma-positive T-cells from H-AGE mice (P < 0.005). Therefore, high AGE intake may provide excess antigenic stimulus for T-cell-mediated diabetes or direct beta-cell injury in NOD mice; both processes are ameliorated by maternal or neonatal exposure to L-AGE nutrition.",1
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610211001025,Sheltered housing or community dwelling: quality of life and ageism among elderly people,"ABSTRACT Background: Previous studies have found correlations between negative perceptions of old age and perceived quality of life (QoL) among elderly people. It has also been suggested that a denial of aging mechanism is employed and might support ageist attitudes among private-sheltered housing tenants compared with elderly people who live in the community and experience intra-generational interactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that tenants of sheltered housing will report more ageist attitudes towards people of their own age, and report a lower QoL than elderly people who live in the community. Methods: The sample included 126 volunteers, aged between 64 and 94 years, who live in private-sheltered housing (n = 32) or in the community (n = 94). The participants completed the Fraboni scale of ageism, and a QoL Inventory (SF-36). Results: People, and men in particular, who live in sheltered housing, reported more intergenerational ageist attitudes than men and women who live in the community. Tenants in sheltered housing expressed lower evaluations of their mental health, but higher evaluations on “social functioning” (QoL scales). Women from sheltered housing reported better mental health than men. Gender and some QoL scales were associated with higher ageism. Conclusions: Differences in ageist attitudes between both dwelling places can be interpreted according to Social Identity Theory, which refers to the impact of the ingroup on social attitudes. Differences in QoL can be understood by the accessibility of social activities in private-sheltered housing. Gender differences in ageism and QoL can be explained by women's better social adjustment. Findings should be regarded with caution because of the small sample.",0
https://doi.org/10.1897/04-190r.1,INFLUENCES OF MATERNAL EXPOSURE ON THE TOLERANCE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE OF DAPHNIA MAGNA UNDER MERCURY STRESS,"We examined the tolerance development to mercury (Hg) by a population of freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia magna) with different pre-exposure histories to Hg. The growth and reproductive performance of the F1 offspring as affected by the maternal (F0) and offspring (F1) exposures was quantified. The F0 daphnids exposed to 2.5 and 25 nM of Hg for 4 d and followed by 4 d of depuration had elevated levels of Hg and metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs), as well as higher tolerance to Hg toxicity than the control daphnids. The higher Hg tolerance may be attributed to the higher proportion of Hg partitioned to the MTLPs. Moreover, significant enhancement of Hg tolerance also was found in the F1 offspring originating from the F0 mothers exposed to 25 nM of Hg, but there was no significant induction of MTLPs in these F1 offspring when compared to the offspring from the control mothers. The Hg tissue concentrations in the F1 neonates were approximately 25% of those in the F0 adults. However, there was similar Hg tolerance in the F2 offspring originating from both the control and Hg-exposed F0 mothers, indicating that the Hg tolerance in the daphnids disappeared two generations after Hg contamination. Further exposure of the F1 offspring to different Hg concentrations (1.5 and 15 nM for 28 d) indicated that maternal exposure history did not affect their growth and reproductive performance, which solely were influenced by the offspring exposure. Unexpectedly, the F1 offspring exposed to Hg had significantly higher final wet weights and reproductive rates than the control groups, suggesting the possibility of Hg hormesis. Furthermore, the maternal exposure had no effect on the Hg accumulation and the MTLP concentrations in the F1 offspring. Therefore, we concluded that the Hg tolerance might disappear quickly once the Hg contamination was removed and the maternal exposure history was not important in determining the physiological performance and Hg accumulation of the subsequent generations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/mutage/14.1.71,Human sperm DNA integrity assessed by the Comet and ELISA assays,"DNA integrity in sperm is essential for the accurate transmission of genetic information and therefore the maintenance of good health in future generations. The ELISA and Comet assays, two techniques that detect DNA damage in cells, are compared in this study of DNA integrity in human sperm. Both techniques rely on alkaline unwinding for the release of single strands of DNA from the nucleus. The ELISA detects single strands immunochemically whereas the Comet assay measures single strands drawn out by electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and quantified by image analysis. The two techniques, both modified for use with sperm, detect similar levels of baseline DNA damage along with similar dose-dependent patterns of induced damage by X-ray irradiation at 10 and 30 Gy (P < 0.05). The assays are also comparable in the detection of a significant protective effect by ascorbic acid (300 and 600 microM) and alpha-tocopherol (30 and 60 microM) on DNA integrity, both at baseline levels and following X-ray irradiation (p < 0.01). The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026932,Epilepsy Caused by an Abnormal Alternative Splicing with Dosage Effect of the SV2A Gene in a Chicken Model,"Photosensitive reflex epilepsy is caused by the combination of an individual's enhanced sensitivity with relevant light stimuli, such as stroboscopic lights or video games. This is the most common reflex epilepsy in humans; it is characterized by the photoparoxysmal response, which is an abnormal electroencephalographic reaction, and seizures triggered by intermittent light stimulation. Here, by using genetic mapping, sequencing and functional analyses, we report that a mutation in the acceptor site of the second intron of SV2A (the gene encoding synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A) is causing photosensitive reflex epilepsy in a unique vertebrate model, the Fepi chicken strain, a spontaneous model where the neurological disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation. This mutation causes an aberrant splicing event and significantly reduces the level of SV2A mRNA in homozygous carriers. Levetiracetam, a second generation antiepileptic drug, is known to bind SV2A, and SV2A knock-out mice develop seizures soon after birth and usually die within three weeks. The Fepi chicken survives to adulthood and responds to levetiracetam, suggesting that the low-level expression of SV2A in these animals is sufficient to allow survival, but does not protect against seizures. Thus, the Fepi chicken model shows that the role of the SV2A pathway in the brain is conserved between birds and mammals, in spite of a large phylogenetic distance. The Fepi model appears particularly useful for further studies of physiopathology of reflex epilepsy, in comparison with induced models of epilepsy in rodents. Consequently, SV2A is a very attractive candidate gene for analysis in the context of both mono- and polygenic generalized epilepsies in humans.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-011-1617-5,Prevalence of segregation distortion in diploid alfalfa and its implications for genetics and breeding applications,"Segregation distortion (SD) is often observed in plant populations; its presence can affect mapping and breeding applications. To investigate the prevalence of SD in diploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), we developed two unrelated segregating F(1) populations and one F(2) population. We genotyped all populations with SSR markers and assessed SD at each locus in each population. The three maps were syntenic and largely colinear with the Medicago truncatula genome sequence. We found genotypic SD for 24 and 34% of markers in the F(1) populations and 68% of markers in the F(2) population; distorted markers were identified on every linkage group. The smaller percentage of genotypic SD in the F(1) populations could be because they were non-inbred and/or due to non-fully informative markers. For the F(2) population, 60 of 90 mapped markers were distorted, and they clustered into eight segregation distortion regions (SDR). Most SDR identified in the F(1) populations were also identified in the F(2) population. Genotypic SD was primarily due to zygotic rather than allelic distortion, suggesting zygotic not gametic selection is the main cause of SD. On the F(2) linkage map, distorted markers in all SDR except two showed heterozygote excess. The severe SD in the F(2) population likely biased genetic distances among markers and possibly also marker ordering and could affect QTL mapping of agronomic traits. To reduce the effects of SD and non-fully informative markers, we suggest constructing linkage maps and conducting QTL mapping in advanced generation populations.",0

It is possible that compared to earlier airbags second-generation airbags provide less injury protection due to their depowered nature.A cohort study was conducted using 1995-2004 national data. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared injury risks for occupants involved in frontal collisions in vehicles wherein a first- or second-generation airbag deployed by body region and injury severity using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Associations were adjusted for crash severity, seatbelt use, seat position, occupant location, and vehicle curb weight.For upper extremity injuries reduced RRs were observed for AIS 1 or greater (RR=0.76, CI 0.67-0.86), AIS 2 or greater (RR=0.76, CI 0.58-1.00) and AIS 3 (RR=0.81, CI 0.64-1.03). Elevated risks were observed for AIS 5 thoracic injuries (RR=1.46, CI 1.04-2.07) but were made null when differences in age and gender were adjusted for.Vehicles equipped with first- and second-generation airbags appear to offer similar protection for front-seated occupants. The observed decreased risks for upper extremity injury and increased risks for severe thoracic injuries warrant further attention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1140-4639(05)80146-7,Les émulsions de fluorocarbures comme transporteurs d'oxygène injectables. Progrès récents et perspectives,"Fluorocarbon emulsions are presently being developed to serve as injectable oxygen carriers (so-called ""blood substitutes""). In this approach oxygen is simply dissolved in the liquid carrier and the amount of gas dissolved is proportional to its partial pressure. Increasing the O2-delivering capacity is therefore achieved more easily by increasing the oxygen content of the air breathed by the patient than by increasing the dose of fluorocarbon administered. The absence of a chemical bond between the gas and its carriers allows over 90% of the transported oxygen to be delivered. The fluorocarbon droplets act as oxygen carriers , and also appear to facilitate its diffusion. Chemically and biologically highly inert, fluorocarbons are excreted by exhalation without being metabolized. The first generation of emulsions, exemplified by Fluosol has only limited efficacy due to its low fluorocarbon content, low intravascular persistence and insufficient stability. It has to be stored and distributed frozen, then reconstituted prior to use. Fluosol has nevertheless been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use during high risk PTCA. The second generation of injectable fluorocarbon emulsions, exemplified by Oxygent is 4-5 times more concentrated and consequently more efficacious than Fluosol. Considerably more stable, this emulsion can be stored for over one year at 5-8 degrees C and is ready for use. The fluorocarbon used has a significantly shorter organ-retention time. The applications of the present emulsions are still limited by their short intravascular persistence, and are those for which prolonged efficacy is not required, which includes perioperative hemodilution, ischemia, cardioplegia, reperfusion, sensitization of tumors to radio- and chemotherapy, organ preservation and diagnosis. The efficacy of the new emulsions has been established in various animal models. The mild side-effects observed in Phase I clinical trials appear to result from a transient activation of the monocyte/macrophage system and to be suppressed prophylactically by cyclooxygenase inhibitors or corticosteroids. Research is presently oriented towards controlling intravascular persistence better, increasing emulsion stability further, minimizing side-effects and optimizing emulsion characteristics for specific indications.",0

,The effect of culture and genotype on motor development of parents and their children.,"The study is based on the observation of 3995 individuals aged from 3 to over 80 years from five habitat types of Poland, ranging from agricultural villages to a large industrial city. We used a set of motor tests described elsewhere and examining the static and explosive muscular strength, agility, coordination and persistent fitness. The study objects were the generations of parents and their children (because of age-dependent differences, the traits of the latter were expressed in T-scores). Factor analysis with rotation Varimax was used to examine family traits. Four latent factors characterizing families were identified. Factor 1 (F1) was related with culture (consciousness). It explained 26% of the variance. F2 described living conditions and explained 22% of the variance. F3 (maternal-genetic) explained 12% of the variance, and factor 4 (father's genetic factor) explained 11% of the variance. These factors have a stronger effect on the motor traits of parents than on those of their children. The two generations were more similar with respect to such traits as the static strength, flexibility, spatial orientation and persistence. They were little similar with respect to explosive power and running agility. A moderate similarity occurred for throw accuracy and body balance. The most important factor in the parental generation is the consciousness (culture level) co-occurring with fitness (only for throw accuracy these were living conditions). The most important factors in the descendant generation were usually beyond the examined family traits. The present results show that in parallel to genetic and maternal factors also cultural factors related to traditional customs and social practices determine motor traits of children.",1

,Three generations of hereditary chronic pancreatitis.,"The patient was a 22 year-old male. Hereditary chronic pancreatitis was suspected as a diagnosis since his mother's uncle had been operated on for chronic pancreatitis 14 years previously at the age of 64 years and his mother had been operated on for chronic pancreatitis with calculi 5 years previously at the age of 40 years. Surgery was needed, since: 1) he had experienced abdominal pain for 8 years; 2) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a marked irregular dilatation in the main pancreatic duct and a marked irregular dilatation and protein plugs in the ductule of the tail of the pancreas; and, 3) pancreatic functional diagnostic (PFD) test examination showed a 75% decrease in exocrine function. If a surgical procedure had not been performed, the patient would likely have experienced calculi formation in the pancreas and a further decrease in exocrine function. Since the patient was very young and had many protein plugs in the dilated ductule of the tail of the pancreas, we decided to perform a spleen-preserving Puestow's procedure with removal of the tail of the pancreas. Clinical and pathological findings of hereditary pancreatitis are reviewed.",0

Shoot architecture, however, has never been studied from a developmental perspective in M. guttatus.We examined the development of branches and flowers in plants from two locally adapted populations of M. guttatus with contrasting flowering times, life histories, and branch numbers. We planted second-generation seed in growth chambers to control for maternal and environmental effects.Most branches occurred at nodes one and two of the main axis. Onset of branching occurred earlier and at a greater frequency in perennials than in annuals. In perennials, almost all flowers occurred at the fifth or more distal nodes. In annuals, most flowers occurred at the third and more distal nodes. Accessory axillary meristems and higher-order branching did not influence shoot architecture.We found no evidence for trade-offs between flowers and branches because axillary meristem number was not limiting: a large number of meristems remained quiescent. If, however, quiescence is a component of meristem allocation strategy, then meristems may be limited despite presence of quiescent meristems. At the two basalmost nodes, branch number was determined by mechanisms governing either meristem initiation or outgrowth, rather than flowering vs. branching. At the third and more distal nodes, heterochronic processes contributed to flowering time and branch number differences between populations.",0

MTHODSs: In the past 15 years, four prospective randomized, controlled studies, conducted by the same group of authors, compared seven prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in 2970 patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery. In 1980/81, a 4-day cefazolin (CFZ) prophylaxis was compared with a 2-day cefuroxime (CFX) administration (n=566). In 1982/83, a 2-day CFX prophylaxis was compared with a two shot ceftriaxone (CRO) prophylaxis (n=512). In 1984/87, a 1-day CFZ prophylaxis was compared with a single shot prophylaxis of CRO (n=883). In 1994/1995, a 4 day combination of amoxicillin (AM) and netilmicin (NET) prophylaxis was compared with a single shot prophylaxis of CFX (n=1009).Total infection rate varied between 4.5 and 5.7%, despite different antimicrobial regimen used and their varying duration. Wound infection rate was 1.1% (range 0.4-2.5%), sepsis rate was 0.8% (range 0.4-1.6%), pneumonia rate 2% (0.7-2.9%), urinary tract infection rate 0.4% (range 0-1.4%), and central venous catheter-related infection rate was 0.4% (0-1%). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.3% (range 0.4-2%). All these differences were not statistically significant.A low infection rate (range 4.5-5.7%) occurred despite changes in duration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimen with cephalosporins of first, second or third generation. As a single shot prophylaxis could nowadays successfully be used in cardiovascular surgery, no postoperative antibiotics should be used, unless an intraoperative or a postoperative infection is documented or in presence of major perioperative complications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1039/c0pp00356e,Evaluation of phototoxicity of dendritic porphyrin-based phosphorescent oxygen probes: an in vitro study,"Biological oxygen measurements by phosphorescence quenching make use of exogenous phosphorescent probes, which are introduced directly into the medium of interest (e.g. blood or interstitial fluid) where they serve as molecular sensors for oxygen. The byproduct of the quenching reaction is singlet oxygen, a highly reactive species capable of damaging biological tissue. Consequently, potential probe phototoxicity is a concern for biological applications. Herein, we compared the ability of polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-coated Pd tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTBP)-based dendritic nanoprobes of three successive generations to sensitize singlet oxygen. It was found that the size of the dendrimer has practically no effect on the singlet oxygen sensitization efficiency in spite of the strong attenuation of the triplet quenching rate with an increase in the dendrimer generation. This unexpected result is due to the fact that the lifetime of the PdTBP triplet state in the absence of oxygen increases with dendritic generation, thus compensating for the concomitant decrease in the rate of quenching. Nevertheless, in spite of their ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, the phosphorescent probes were found to be non-phototoxic when compared with the commonly used photodynamic drug Photofrin in a standard cell-survival assay. The lack of phototoxicity is presumably due to the inability of PEGylated probes to associate with cell surfaces and/or penetrate cellular membranes. In contrast, conventional photosensitizers bind to cell components and act by generating singlet oxygen inside or in the immediate vicinity of cellular organelles. Therefore, PEGylated dendritic probes are safe to use for tissue oxygen measurements as long as the light doses are less than or equal to those commonly employed in photodynamic therapy.",0

The SAMP6 mouse strain displays unusually low BMD at maturity, and age-dependent osteopenia associated with defective osteoblastogenesis. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing bone density, we constructed crosses between SAMP6 and either AKR/J or SAMP6, two related mouse strains of higher peak BMD. Due to common ancestry of these strains, intercross parents differed at only 39-40% of 227 highly-polymorphic genotyping markers, thus restricting our search to this informative portion of the genome and reducing the number of mice required for QTL significance. Using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), we measured spinal BMD in F2 cross progeny at 4 months of age, and selectively genotyped those in the highest and lowest quartiles for BMD. Based on linear regression of bone density on genotype, including Composite Interval Mapping to enhance mapping precision while adjusting for effects of distal markers, we identified multiple QTLs significantly affecting spinal BMD; these were mapped to regions of chromosomes 2 (two sites, one confirmed in both crosses), 7, 11, 13 and 16. One of these loci had been previously identified as a significant bone-density QTL, while 3 substantiate QTLs suggested by a low-power study of 24 recombinant-inbred mouse lines. Such recurrent appearance of QTLs, especially in crosses involving distantly-related strains, implies that polymorphism at these loci may be favored by evolution and might underlie variation in peak bone density among humans.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-4358-1-26,,"This review examines the role of donor human milk banking in international human rights documents and global health policies. For countries looking to improve child health, promotion, protection and support of donor human milk banks has an important role to play for the most vulnerable of infants and children. This review is based on qualitative triangulation research conducted for a doctoral dissertation. The three methods used in triangulation were 1) writing as a method of inquiry, 2) an integrative research review, and 3) personal experience and knowledge of the topic. Discussion of the international human rights documents and global health policies shows that there is a wealth of documentation to support promotion, protection and support of donor milk banking as an integral part of child health and survival. By utilizing these policy documents, health ministries, professional associations, and donor milk banking associations can find rationales for establishing, increasing or continuing to provide milk banking services in any country, and thereby improve the health of children and future generations of adults.",0

The injection of prostaglandin (PG) F 2α caused suppression of mating call answering. Neural correlates of mating calling were triggered by electrical stimulation of the anterior preoptic nucleus in the isolated brainstem of male, Northern leopard frogs ( Rana p. pipiens ). The addition of PGF 2α to the bath completely abolished the correlates of mating calling without changing the correlates of pulmonary respiration. The suppression of mating calling shown here, along with the suppression of release signalling described by Diakow and Nemiroff (1981) , supports the hypothesis of a close interrelation between the neural circuits of these two calls. The suppression of the neural correlates of mating calling in an isolated preparation shows a central site of action of the PG. The retention of normal correlates of pulmonary respiration, even after suppression of mating calling correlates, suggests that the generation of mating calling patterns involves the extension and pulsing of the expiratory phase of breathing.",0

Duff – An example of established knowledge subsequently ‘hidden in plain sight’,"Perhaps the earliest authoritative measurement of a social class gradient in IQ, with a stratification of occupations among the parents of children with different IQs, is seen in two fascinating papers published in 1923 and 1929 in the British Journal of Psychology. The authors were GH Thomson and JF Duff (both of whom were later knighted) and the papers’ main findings were confirmed by later researchers. Results of an intelligence test administered to 13419 children aged 11–12 were analyzed according to parent’s occupation. The average children’s IQ at extremes of social class among their parents included clergymen-121, teachers-116 and bankers and managers-112 at the upper end; while at the lower end there were ‘cripples and invalids’-94, cattlemen-93, hawkers and chimneysweeps-91, and the ‘insane, criminal’-88. More than 100 specific categories of parental occupations were then combined into 13 social classes, with their children’s average IQ as follows: Professional-112; Managers-110; Higher Commercial-109; Army, Navy, Police, Postmen-106; Shopkeeping-105; Engineers [ie. apprenticed craftsmen, such as mining engineers]-103; Foremen-103; Building trades-102; Metal workers, shipbuilders-101; Miscellaneous industrial workers-101; Miners and quarrymen-98; Agriculture-98; Labourers-96. A follow-up study compared an ‘intelligent’ group (IQ 136 plus) with a matched IQ 95–105 ‘control’ group. IQ testing at age 11–12 was predictive of teacher’s reports of higher levels of intelligence and health at age 16; and better performance in official examinations. The occupations of fathers, grandfathers and uncles were consistent with occupation being indicative of ‘an inherited quality’ (i.e. IQ) and there was regression from parents to grandparents and uncles among the ’intelligent’ but not among controls. Other findings included a wider variance in intelligence among boys than girls, and descriptions of the predictive value of IQ in estimating future education, examinations and health. Although the distribution, heredity and predictive value of childhood IQ measurements was once quite widely understood, for the last few decades IQ research has been regarded as morally-suspect and IQ scientists subjected to vilification, persecution and sanctions. Ignorance and misunderstanding of IQ is the norm among intellectual elites in schools, universities, the media, politics and public administration. Consequently IQ research is actively-shunned, and has near-zero influence on public policies. Since this area of science has so been comprehensively ‘disappeared’ from public consciousness as a result of socio-political pressure; it seems probable that other similarly solid and vital domains of scientific knowledge may also be ‘hidden in plain sight’.",1

This study is aimed at assessing reliability (repeatabilty and reproducibility) in the Osstell Mentor® system using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as the statistical method.ISQ measurements of RFA were carried out by means of the Osstell Mentor® instrument in 58 implants in 19 patients. Six measurements were performed on each implant by means of two different Smart-Pegs (I and II). Three consecutive measurements were registered with each transducer.Average ISQ varied from 72.43 to 72.60 and 73.26 in the first, second and third measurements, respectively with the SamrtPeg I and from 72.98 to 73.26 and 73.74 in the first, second and third measurements, respectively with the SamrtPeg II . Exactly equal values were observed in 10.43 and 12.1% of the cases with Smart-Pegs I and II, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.96 and 0.96 for Smart Pegs I and II, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility was 0.97 for both Smart-Pegs I and II.The RFA system contributed by Osstell Mentor® renders almost perfect reproducibility and repeatability, as proven by statistical analysis carried out by means of ICC with 95% confidence level.

https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1006037308167,,"Dehydrins (LEA D11 proteins) are the products of multigene families in a number of higher plants [5]. To date, however, only one dehydrin locus, dhn1 (a major embryo and drought-induced protein of ca. 18 kDa) has been placed on chromosome 6L of the genetic linkage map of maize. The presence of a larger, ca. 40 kDa embryo protein that is also specifically detected by anti-dehydrin antibodies had been observed in some maize inbreds, including B73, suggesting that other dhn loci may exist. The ca. 22 kDa and ca. 40 kDa immunopositive proteins were purified from B73 and their amino acid compositions determined. The two proteins' amino acid compositions are typical of dehydrins, yet they differ from each other, indicating that they are distinct dhn gene products. Different size alleles for both proteins, or presence/absence in the case of the ca. 40 kDa protein, were evident from comparisons of embryo proteins of various maize inbreds. Analysis of segregating F2 progeny derived from self-pollination of F1 hybrids from four crosses (B73 × OH43, Mo17 × A632, AHO × A632, Latente × A632) revealed that alleles of the two genes assort independently. Map positions of the two dhn loci were then determined using two maize recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations. The predicted map position of the gene controlling production of the ca. 22 kDa protein confirmed that this protein is the product of the dhn1 gene. The gene encoding the ca. 40 kDa dehydrin-like protein maps to a new locus on chromosome 9S near wx1, which we have named dhn2.",0

In this study, an Enterobacteriaceae was isolated in pure growth from the mid-stream urine of a 67-year old renal transplant recipient with urinary tract infection. Conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern resembling any known member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The Vitek system (GNI+) showed that it was 18% Leclercia adecarboxylata and 55% Klebsiella ozaenae; whereas the API system (20E) showed that it was 99.8% Rahnella aquatilis. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing showed that there was 7 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter cloacae, 18 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter asburiae, 17 base differences between the isolate and Enterobacter cancerogenus, 35 base differences between the isolate and K. ozaenae, 27 base differences between the isolate and L. adecarboxylata, and 72 base differences between the isolate and R. aquatilis, indicating that the isolate most closely resembled a strain of E. cloacae. Identification of the organism in this study is important, as the choice of antibiotics would be radically different. In this case, cephalosporins should be avoided regardless of in-vitro susceptibility as cephalosporins are well-known to select for AmpC derepressed mutants in Enterobacter, and previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins is more likely to be associated with multidrug resistant Enterobacter isolates than is administration of antibiotics that do not include a third-generation cephalosporin.",0

An Easy Route to Pyran-2-ones, Constituents of Tobacco Flavor","The ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reactions of homoallylic acrylates bearing alkyl substituents on various positions of their skeleton afford the corresponding pentenolides in the presence of carbene ruthenium catalysts. For R3 = R4 = H, or R3 = Me, R4 = H, the reactions are catalyzed by complex [RuCl2(PCy3)2(=CHPh)], while a second-generation Grubbs catalyst is required when R3 = H and R4 = Me, R3 = R4 = Me, or R3 = i-Pr and R4 = H. Alkyl substitution at the homoallylic carbon (R1, R2) increases the yield of the reaction when both the acrylic and/or homoallylic double bonds are methyl-substituted. The interaction of the catalyst with the substrate in the initiation stage involves the homoallylic double bond rather than the acrylic moiety, and the resulting alkylidene species from the first-generation Grubbs catalyst can be observed by 1H and 31P NMR. The racemic tobacco constituents 4-isopropyl-5,6-dihydropyran-2-one and 4-isopropyltetrahydropyran-2-one are prepared via a short reaction sequence, involving the RCM reaction as the key transformation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/13682820304814,Intergenerational communication: fundamental but under-exploited theory for speech and language therapy with older people,"There is a body of research literature already applied in speech and language therapy practice that is concerned with communication between children and adults and the adaptations adults make to facilitate the development of language in children. There is much less and more recent literature concerned with intergenerational communication involving older people and older people in institutional care. This has not yet impacted on speech and language therapy practice, especially in the area of training others. The aims of this paper are (1) to describe some of the main theoretical concepts associated with intergenerational communication, (2) to present the results from a study of the opinions about and experiences of intergenerational communication in which children, community- based older women and professional carers of older people were included and (3) to discuss the implications for speech and language therapy practice. A hypothesis for the study was that views on and attitudes towards communication and ageing would vary among the age groups. Some of the main concepts and models associated with intergenerational communication with older people are reviewed, including the communication predicament and enhancement models and the concept of patronizing communication. A qualitative study of three different age groups of (mainly) women was undertaken using a variety of methods of data elicitation (including written questionnaire and focus group discussion). Themes arising from the data were illuminated using content analysis. Participants' responses demonstrate some current generally positive views across the life-span on what it means to be old and the value of communication with older people. The implications for speech and language therapy practice are outlined, with the main emphasis on the potential use of intergenerational communication theory in developing a new focus for training other staff groups who care for older people and for measures of effectiveness of such in-service training.",0

Prerequisite for its evolution is heritable genetic variation. Starting with 102 genotypes of the stoloniferous herb Ranunculus reptans, we performed one selection experiment on spatial spread per rosette as measure of guerillaness (broad-sense heritability 0.198) and another on plasticity in this trait in response to competition (broad-sense heritability 0.067). After two generations, spatial spread was 36.9% higher in the high line than in the low line (realized heritability +/- SE 0.149 +/- 0.039). Moreover, compared with the low line genotypes of the high line had fewer rosettes, a lower proportion of flowering rosettes, a higher proportion of rooted rosettes, more branches per rosette, longer internodes and longer leaves. In the second experiment, we found no significant direct response to selection for high and low plasticity in spatial spread (realized heritability +/- SE -0.029 +/- 0.063), despite a significant correlated response in plasticity in the length of the first three stolon internodes. Our study indicates a high potential for further evolution of the clonal growth form in R. reptans, but not for its plasticity, and it demonstrates that the clonal growth form does not evolve independently of other clonal life-history characteristics.",0

Gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea, contains an azabicyclo-octyl ring, which has been described to have antioxidant properties. However, the effect of gliclazide on endothelial function is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of gliclazide on endothelial function in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (diabetic group; n=33). A control group of non-diabetic subjects was also enrolled (n=25). All of the diabetic patients were treated with gliclazide for 12 weeks. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) before and after treatment. We also determined the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which were defined by CD45(low)/CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) and quantified by flow cytometry, because these cells may offer a new biomarker for circulatory diseases. Oxidative stress was evaluated in terms of the serum levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide. FMD, circulating EPC count and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly lower in the diabetic group than in the control group at baseline (P<0.05), and improved significantly following gliclazide treatment (P<0.05). Malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels were higher in the diabetic group than in the control group at baseline (P<0.05), and decreased following gliclazide treatment. These results suggest that gliclazide could improve endothelial function in diabetes, which may be related to its antioxidant properties.",0

Many classes of chemicals may form DNA adducts and there may or may not be a defined mechanism to remove a particular adduct from DNA independent of replication. Many compounds and metabolites that bind DNA also readily bind existing proteins; some classes of toxins and DNA adducts have the capacity to inactivate a repair enzyme and divert the repair process competitively. This paper formulates anintracellular dynamic model for one aspect of the action of toxins that form DNA adducts, recognizing a capacity for removal of those adducts by a repair enzyme combined with reaction of the toxin and/or the DNA adduct to inactivate the repair enzyme. This particular model illustrates the possible saturation of repair enzyme capacity by the toxin dosage and shows that bistable behavior can occur, with the potential to induce abrupt shifts away from steady-state equilibria. The model suggests that bistable behavior, dose and variation between individuals or tissues may combine under certain conditions to amplify the biological effect of dose observed as DNA aduction and its consequences as mutation. A model recognizing stochastic phenomena also indicates that variation in within-cell toxin concentration may promote jumps between stable equilibria.",0

As treatment approaches have advanced, more attention has been given to re-integrating patients into their psychosocial environments, rather than simply monitoring psychotic symptoms. The development of the second-generation antipsychotics raised hope that these medications would provide better quality of life improvement than conventional antipsychotics. This improvement is particularly relevant early in the course of schizophrenia.To address these considerations, improvements in measures of general health and social function (determined using the SF-36) were assessed in 195 patients with first-episode schizophrenia for up to one year following randomization to either olanzapine or haloperidol in a double blind clinical trial. We hypothesized that olanzapine would demonstrate better improvement on these measures than haloperidol. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a repeated measure model with SF-36 scores as the outcome, and treatment group, time, time2, time-by-treatment group interaction, and time2-by-treatment group interaction as fixed effects.Both treatments demonstrated similar changes on the SF-36. Independent of treatment, patients demonstrated significant improvements in most of the SF-36 subscales, which approached normative scores by the end of one year of treatment. Forty-six of 100 olanzapine-treated patients and 37 of 95 haloperidol-treated patients completed the one year of this study (p<.4).These results suggest an important initial treatment goal for patients with new onset schizophrenic disorders, namely that they can expect to recover significant quality of life and social function at least initially in treatment.",0

The data were generated by the ESCALE study, which included 764 AL cases and 1,681 controls in 2003–2004. The data on maternal smoking during pregnancy were obtained by standardized telephone interview of the cases’ and controls’ mothers. The genotypes CYP1A1*2A/2B (rs4646903), CYP2E1*5 (rs2031920, rs3813867), NQO1*2 (rs1800566), NAT2*5 (rs1801280), and EPHX1 exon 3 (rs1051740) and exon 4 (rs2234922) were obtained using a high-throughput platform and imputation for untyped polymorphisms. The analyses were restricted to the 493 cases (433 cases of lymphoblastic (ALL) and 51 of myeloblastic (AML) leukemia) and 441 controls with at least 2 grandparents born in Europe, who were genotyped with individual call rates greater than 95%. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression in case–control analyses and, for gene–gene and gene–environment interactions, by case-only analyses. ALL and AML were not associated with either maternal smoking during pregnancy or candidate polymorphisms in CYP1A1, CYP2E1, EPHX1, and NQO1. Carrying two NAT2*5 alleles was significantly associated with ALL (OR = 1.8 [1.3–2.5]). The analyses also suggested an interaction between three genes involved in benzene metabolism CYP2E1, NQO1, and EPHX1. There was no interaction between maternal smoking and any of the polymorphisms under study. The ESCALE study did not evidence the interaction between CYP1A1*2A/2B and maternal smoking suggested previously. The association with NAT2*5 and the gene–gene interactions need to be replicated.",0

The compounds [RhCl(COD)(BMes)] (COD is 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and cis-[RhCl(CO)2(BMes)] were used to probe the steric and electronic parameters of BMes.

Nonetheless, changes in the hydrocarbon backbone subtly affected the stereoelectronic properties of these ligands. Accordingly, the corresponding [RuCl2(PCy3)(NHC)(=CHPh)] complexes displayed different catalytic behaviors in the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of α,ω-dienes.

The results showed that the element Na and Ti could not be detected in the space group, and the levels of K and Mn were enhanced by 1.16 and 1.15 times as these elements were measured in ground group, but other elements' contents declined to different degrees, and the most notable elements are Si and P, decreasing by 82.1% and 71.2% accordingly; there is some whewellite in the ground group, whereas much less is found in the space group. The ground group contains inulin, however none in the space group. Spaceflight breeding can harvest significantly mutated specific Chinese herbal medicines varieties. The combination of two testing techniques has a positive role in space breeding applied in cultivation of medicinal plants.",0
,Antipsychotic polypharmacy or monotherapy,"The concurrent use of more than one drug to treat syndromes and diseases is common in medicine as well as in psychiatry. Despite strong recommendation by experts to employ monotherapy whenever possible, the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) has greatly increased, particularly since the advent of the Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA). The literature which consists of three RCTs, several naturalistic cohort studies and numerous case reports does not show convincing evidence of APP efficacy. The best results were seen in studies of augmentation of clozapine response by a second antipsychotic. Studies which examined the side effect burden showed higher rates of anticholinergic and extrapyramidal side effects of APP compared to monotherapy, but these differences tended to disappear when total dosage was controlled for. The relative cost of APP may be higher than monotherapy, but very little data are available. Experts recommend APP in a few special clinical situations: (a) for augmentation when a patient fails to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, especially with clozapine; (b) in some instances of failed cross-taper of antipsychotics; (c) adding a FGA to a SGA for agitation during acute treatment of psychosis. Indiscriminate condemnation of APP is misdirected, the real culprit being incompetent pharmacotherapy. Improved education and advances in the science of psychopharmacology will lead to more specific antipsychotic therapies and ultimately to less need for APP.",0
https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.53.4.830,A distinctive autosomal dominant vacuolar neuromyopathy linked to 19p13,"Objective: To characterize a kindred with a distinctive autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder. Background: The authors studied a large Italian family affected by a progressive neuromyopathy. Ten individuals over three generations were affected. The disease was characterized by onset from the late teens to early 50s with distal leg weakness and atrophy, development of generalized muscle weakness with distal-to-proximal progression sparing facial and ocular muscles, dysphonia and dysphagia, pes cavus and areflexia, variable clinical expression ranging from subclinical myopathy to severely disabling weakness, and mixed neurogenic and myopathic abnormalities on electromyography. Methods: Morphologic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural studies were performed in muscle biopsies from three affected patients. A genomewide linkage analysis through the genotyping of 292 microsatellite markers spanning the 22 autosomes was undertaken to map the disorder segregating in this family. Results: All muscle biopsies showed variation of fiber size, panesterase-positive angular fibers, mild to severe fibrosis, and numerous “rimmed vacuoles.” Electron microscopy failed to demonstrate the nuclear or cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions specific of inclusion-body myopathies and, accordingly, immunohistochemistry did not show any positivity with SMI-31 antibodies detecting hyperphosphorylated tau. Preliminary analysis of 292 microsatellite markers provided evidence for linkage to chromosome 19p13. Conclusions: This distinctive autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by a vacuolar neuromyopathy. Localization to chromosome 19p13 will allow the genetic relationship between this disease and inherited myopathies with rimmed vacuoles, in particular autosomal dominant inclusion-body myopathies, to be defined.",0
https://doi.org/10.3928/1081-597x-19980501-12,Angle-fixated Anterior Chamber Phakic Intraocular Lens for Myopia of -7 to -19 Diopters,"To assess the safety and efficacy of a second generation, anterior chamber phakic intraocular lens (Baikoff Model ZB5M) in patients with high myopia.One hundred and twenty-one patients (134 eyes) with myopia of -7.00 to -18.80 D were implanted with the ZB5M lens and followed for 18 to 52 months; the number of eyes evaluated was: 6 months (104 eyes), 1 year (91 eyes), 18 months (78 eyes), 2 years (68 eyes), and 3 years (35 eyes).Postoperative spherical equivalent refraction averaged -1.00 D and the error in refractive correction (achieved minus intended) averaged -0.40 D during the first 2 years, increasing -to -1.30 D refraction and -0.60 D error in refractive correction at 3 years. At 2 years, approximately 40% of eyes had a spherical equivalent refraction within +/-0.50 D, and 65% within +/-1.00 D. The uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.048 at baseline and 0.5 at 3 years; near visual acuity was 0.21 at baseline and approximately 0.7 over the 3 years of follow-up. Spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity at baseline was 0.54; it improved to 0.7. Near visual acuity was 0.65 at baseline and it improved to approximately 0.75. Endothelial cell counts in the central and peripheral cornea were reduced by an average 3.3% at 6 months, declining an additional 1% to 2% over the remaining follow-up period. Regression analyses indicated that most of the endothelial cell loss was due to surgery. Additional complications included halos/glare in 37 of 133 eyes (27.8%) and iris retraction with pupillary ovalization in 30 of 133 eyes (22.6%). The intraocular lens was exchanged in four of 133 eyes (3.0%) and removed in three of 133 eyes (2.3%), the latter because of halos (one eye) and a flat anterior chamber with severe inflammation (two eyes).Implantation of the Baikoff ZB5M lens in the anterior chamber of phakic eyes significantly reduced high myopia and produced a stable refractive outcome over the 3 years, accompanied by marked improvement in uncorrected distance visual acuity and minimal, non-progressive damage to the corneal endothelium. Frequent complications included pupillary ovalization and halos/glare. Improvements in accuracy of IOL power calculations are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881107087373,Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis,"Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2012.12.001,Assessment of GE food safety using ‘-omics’ techniques and long-term animal feeding studies,"Despite the fact that a thorough, lengthy and costly evaluation of genetically engineered (GE) crop plants (including compositional analysis and toxicological tests) is imposed before marketing some European citizens remain sceptical of the safety of GE food and feed. In this context, are additional tests necessary? If so, what can we learn from them? To address these questions, we examined data from 60 recent high-throughput '-omics' comparisons between GE and non-GE crop lines and 17 recent long-term animal feeding studies (longer than the classical 90-day subchronic toxicological tests), as well as 16 multigenerational studies on animals. The '-omics' comparisons revealed that the genetic modification has less impact on plant gene expression and composition than that of conventional plant breeding. Moreover, environmental factors (such as field location, sampling time, or agricultural practices) have a greater impact than transgenesis. None of these '-omics' profiling studies has raised new safety concerns about GE varieties; neither did the long-term and multigenerational studies on animals. Therefore, there is no need to perform such long-term studies in a case-by-case approach, unless reasonable doubt still exists after conducting a 90-day feeding test. In addition, plant compositional analysis and '-omics' profiling do not indicate that toxicological tests should be mandatory. We discuss what complementary fundamental studies should be performed and how to choose the most efficient experimental design to assess risks associated with new GE traits. The possible need to update the current regulatory framework is discussed.",0

The fish concentrated Dursban approximately 1700 times. Survival of first-generation fish was adversely affected at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 60 days. A significant increase in deformities occurred at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days. Growth was significantly reduced at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days and at 1.21 micrograms/liter by 60 days. Maturation of the first-generation fish was reduced at all Dursban exposures and reproduction was significantly reduced at 0.63 micrograms/liter and above. Growth and estimated biomass of 30-day-old second-generation fish were significantly reduced at 0.12 micrograms/liter, the lowest concentration tested. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was significantly inhibited at 0.27 micrograms/liter and above. AChE inhibition ranged from near 10% in fish exposed at 0.12 micrograms/liter to 89% for those exposed at 2.68 micrograms/liter. Inhibition results are compared to other results demonstrated during the chronic study. The use of exposure units (exposure concentration X exposure duration) is discussed as a tool for determining the effects of organophosphate pesticides on the environment.",1
,"[Anticonvulsant and forced swim anti-immobility effects of tetrahydro-N, N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenyl-3-furanemethanamine (AE37): common action mechanism?].","Tetrahydro-N, N-dimethyl-2, 2-diphenyl-3-furanemethanamine (AE 37) is a newly synthesized anticonvulsant drug efficient against electrogenic (maximal electroshock: MES) or pentetrazole (PTZ) induced tonic convulsions of mice. It also antagonizes the immobility of adult or aged mice in the forced swim test (FST), which is used to detect antidepressive properties. Neurochemical changes induced by AE37 (antagonistic action on the sodium channel currents and on the receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) could generate the aforementioned pharmacological properties, whereas the partial agonistic action of AE 37 on the brain muscarinic receptors seems to confer to this drug characteristics of third generation antiepileptic.",0
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2005.0437,Genetic consequences of sex-biased dispersal in a solitary carnivore: Yellowstone cougars,"Male-biased dispersal is a common trait in mammals, including carnivores, but its genetic consequences at the population level have been rarely considered for solitary species. We used long-term genetic data from cougars ( Puma concolor ) in and around Yellowstone National Park to test predictions based on differences in dispersal behaviour among males and females. Consistent with frequent long-distance dispersal of males, we found support for our prediction of less than expected allele sharing in pair-wise comparisons. In contrast, female residents present at the same time and females separated by few generations failed to share more alleles than expected, contrary to our predictions based on limited female dispersal. However, we find that genetic contributions of females with higher reproductive success were still noticeable in subsequent generations, consistent with female offspring showing fidelity to their natal area. These results highlight the importance of male dispersal for inbreeding avoidance, but do not indicate that short-distance dispersal or philopatry in female cougars results in spatial clustering of related individuals.",0
,Maternal nutritional depletion.,"The author discusses maternal nutritional depletion, the negative energy balance and/or micronutrient deficiencies resulting from the energetic burden of frequent reproductive cycling combined with undernutrition and overexertion, and its impact upon a woman's health and nutritional status and that of her offspring. The article is therefore concerned with the impact of nutritional depletion which occurs during a woman's life cycle, as opposed to the effects of nutritional depletion which occur intergenerationally. A brief summary is presented of the recognition and controversy regarding the effects of reproductive stress followed by a description of the factors which make assessment and identification of specific consequences so complex, with approaches suggested to alleviate maternal nutritional depletion. Policy directions and areas for research are suggested.",1
https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1011583210549,,"Mizolastine is a second generation antihistamine agent approved in Europe for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and skin conditions for which Sanofi∼Synthelabo is developing a pediatric solution. Our objective was to design the population pharmacokinetic (PK) study of mizolastine pediatric solution in children. A bioavailability study of this solution compared to the marketed tablet was performed in 18 young volunteers. These PK data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a two-compartment open model with zero-order absorption. From the estimated parameters, we designed population PK studies in two groups of children: 6 to 12 years and 2 to 6 years, respectively. To compare several population designs and to derive the optimal ones, we used the determinant of the Fisher information matrix of the population characteristics using a first-order expansion of the model. We have evaluated a “reference” population design with 10 samples (from 0.25 to 36 hr after drug intake) per child in 6 children, which could not be implemented in practice for ethical reasons. We then derived optimal population designs with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 samples per child and a total of 60 samples. Finally, the designs that were implemented in the population PK study were “compromise” population designs with 60 samples; one defined for 20 children 6 to 12 years old , and one with 24 children 2 to 6 years. In the older group, the population design involved 8 children with a catheter from which 6 samples at time 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 2, 3, and 6 hr after drug intake are collected, and 12 children with only one sample at time 8, 12, 24, or 36 hr. In the younger group, the population design involved 15 children with a catheter who are divided in three groups with four samples at different times from 0.25 to 6 hr after drug intake, and 12 children with only one sample at time 8, 12, 18, or 24 hr. The expected average increase of variances of these designs compared to the reference design were 1.6 and 1.8 for the older and younger group, respectively, which was decided to be acceptable. Better population designs would have involved three groups of children with five samples per child but could not be implemented in practice. The data of the PK study in children 6 to 12 years were available and were analyzed using NONMEM. A total of 53 concentrations were obtained in 18 children. The same two-compartment model with zero-order absorption was used. The interindividual variability in children was small. The estimated population parameters in children 6 to 12 years, were 0.28 L/kg for Vc/F, 0.10 L/hr per kg for CL/F, 0.53 hr−1 for λ1, 0.076 hr−1 for λ2 , and 0.49 hr for T  abs  . These values were close to the median values observed in young volunteers when standardized to 70 kg; notably, CL/F in L/hr per kg was similar, so that a dose of 0.15 mg/kg o.d. for mizolastine pediatric solution should give an equivalent area under the curve to a 10 mg o.d. tablet in adults.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmm117,Prevalence of Orphans among HIV Infected Children--a Preliminary Study from a Pediatric HIV Centre in Western India,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of orphaned HIV-infected children in Mumbai, India and analyze whether orphanhood affects care of these children. This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 147 HIV-infected children referred to our pediatric HIV clinic at B. J. Wadia Hospital for Children (Mumbai, India). All children underwent a detailed history and clinical examination. Transmission of HIV was determined by parental HIV status, history of blood transfusion or sexual exposure. Orphan status was determined by verbal autopsy of parent death (either mother or father or both). Factors affected by orphan status such as follow up, caregiver, antiretroviral treatment and age of the child when orphaned was determined. Fifty nine (40%) HIV-infected children were orphans. In 28 children (19%), father had died; in 20 children (13.6%), mother had died; in 11 children (7.5%) both parents had died and in 2 children (1.4%), parents death status was not known. Cause of death was AIDS in 19 parents (38%) and TB in 21 parents (42%). The mean age of the child when mother had died was 5.6 +/- 2.2 years; when father had died was 7.08 +/- 3.5 years and when both parents had died was 10.9 +/- 2.4 years (p < 0.0001). There was no statistical difference in follow up (p = 0.48) or initiation of antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.04) in orphaned and nonorphaned children. In orphaned children, grandparents (5.4%) and aunts (4.8%) took responsibility of taking care of the children. Only two children (1.4%) were put in orphanages. Prevalence of HIV-infected orphans is high (40%). However, there is no difference in HIV care between orphans and nonorphans.",0

https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.078204.108,Nested Patch PCR enables highly multiplexed mutation discovery in candidate genes,"Medical resequencing of candidate genes in individual patient samples is becoming increasingly important in the clinic and in clinical research. Medical resequencing requires the amplification and sequencing of many candidate genes in many patient samples. Here we introduce Nested Patch PCR, a novel method for highly multiplexed PCR that is very specific, can sensitively detect SNPs and mutations, and is easy to implement. This is the first method that couples multiplex PCR with sample-specific DNA barcodes and next-generation sequencing to enable highly multiplex mutation discovery in candidate genes for multiple samples in parallel. In our pilot study, we amplified exons from colon cancer and matched normal human genomic DNA. From each sample, we successfully amplified 96% (90 of 94) targeted exons from across the genome, totaling 21.6 kbp of sequence. Ninety percent of all sequencing reads were from targeted exons, demonstrating that Nested Patch PCR is highly specific. We found that the abundance of reads per exon was reproducible across samples. We reliably detected germline SNPs and discovered a colon tumor specific nonsense mutation in APC, a gene causally implicated in colorectal cancer. With Nested Patch PCR, candidate gene mutation discovery across multiple individual patient samples can now utilize the power of second-generation sequencing.",0

https://doi.org/10.1177/1076029610395571,Lupus Anticoagulant Interference in Activated Protein C Resistance Testing,"Second-generation activated protein C resistance (APC-R) assay was developed to avert interferences from lupus anticoagulant (LA) and warfarin therapy by prediluting the patient sample with factor V (FV)-depleted plasma. We investigated the effect of LA on the second generation APC-R assay in 121 LA-positive patients. Twenty-five APC-R-positive patients were tested for the mutation in FV (Leiden, Hong Kong, and Cambridge). Eleven had FV Leiden and twelve were negative for any mutation (2 were not tested). Of 12, 8 had APC-R suggestive of heterozygous and 4 had APC-R suggestive of homozygous defects. These patients had strong LA activity, compared to those with concurrent FVL. This was associated with a trend toward increased thrombosis risk compared to those with normal APC-R. These findings suggest that LA causes acquired APC-R, reflecting an in vivo pathophysiologic effect of LA rather than merely an in vitro phenomenon even with the second generation APC-R assay.",0
,[Risedronate].,"Risedronate has recently been approved as a drug for osteoporosis treatment in Japan. According to its chemical structure, risedronate is designated a third generation bisphosphonate, which has potent anti-resorptive activity. Clinical studies conducted in Japan, North America and/or Europe revealed that risedronate reduces the risks of hip fractures and vertebral fractures by around 30% and around 50% compared with placebo over three years, respectively, and increases lumber spine BMD by around 5% at one year after starting treatment. In addition, risedronate produces a rapid and clinically important reduction in the risk of vertebral fracture and bone formed during risedronate treatment was histologically normal. Bone turnover markers, e.g., deoxypyridinoline, NTx, are reduced by around 40% (maximum). Although some bisphosphonates have been associated with upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract adverse events, a pooled analysis of 9 placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted outside Japan revealed no evidence that risedronate was associated with an increased frequency of adverse effects in the GI tract when compared with placebo.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2010.04994.x,Who are the missing parents? Grandparentage analysis identifies multiple sources of gene flow into a wild population,"In order to increase the size of declining salmonid populations, supplementation programmes intentionally release fish raised in hatcheries into the wild. Because hatchery-born fish often have lower fitness than wild-born fish, estimating rates of gene flow from hatcheries into wild populations is essential for predicting the fitness cost to wild populations. Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have both freshwater resident and anadromous (ocean-going) life history forms, known as rainbow trout and steelhead, respectively. Juvenile hatchery steelhead that ‘residualize’ (become residents rather than go to sea as intended) provide a previously unmeasured route for gene flow from hatchery into wild populations. We apply a combination of parentage and grandparentage methods to a three-generation pedigree of steelhead from the Hood River, Oregon, to identify the missing parents of anadromous fish. For fish with only one anadromous parent, 83% were identified as having a resident father while 17% were identified as having a resident mother. Additionally, we documented that resident hatchery males produced more offspring with wild anadromous females than with hatchery anadromous females. One explanation is the high fitness cost associated with matings between two hatchery fish. After accounting for all of the possible matings involving steelhead, we find that only 1% of steelhead genes come from residualized hatchery fish, while 20% of steelhead genes come from wild residents. A further 23% of anadromous steelhead genes come from matings between two resident parents. If these matings mirror the proportion of matings between residualized hatchery fish and anadromous partners, then closer to 40% of all steelhead genes come from wild trout each generation. These results suggest that wild resident fish contribute substantially to endangered steelhead ‘populations’ and highlight the need for conservation and management efforts to fully account for interconnected Oncorhynchus mykiss life histories.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/17455057.2.1.115,Bisphosphonates as Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer,"Great strides have been made over the last 20 years in the treatment of breast cancer and despite an increasing incidence, the number of deaths has fallen sharply since the late 1980s. The advent of new therapies, including taxanes and aromatase inhibitors, and exciting results announced recently using trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive patients should decrease this even further. However, although most patients present with disease that appears to be localized to the breast, a significant proportion of women will eventually develop metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, the detection and treatment of micrometastatic disease represents perhaps the most important remaining challenge in breast cancer management, and is the focus of extensive ongoing research. Bone is the most frequent site of distant relapse, accounting for approximately 40% of all first recurrences. In addition to the well recognized release of bone cell-activating factors from the tumor, it is now appreciated that the release of bone-derived growth factors and cytokines from resorbing bone can attract cancer cells to the bone surface and facilitate their growth and proliferation. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone osteolysis and the inhibition of bone resorption could therefore have an effect on the development and progression of metastatic bone disease. They could represent an adjuvant therapeutic strategy of potential importance. Clinical trial results with the early bisphosphonate, clodronate, have proved inconclusive. A large, randomized, controlled trial has recently completed accrual and should provide the definitive answer to the question of the role of clodronate in this setting. More potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates have also shown enhanced antitumor effects in preclinical evaluation and further studies are required to determine whether this antitumor potential of bisphosphonates translates to the clinical setting. Adjuvant bisphosphonates are, therefore, currently only recommended in the research setting and clinical trials evaluating the adjuvant use of these newer compounds are currently recruiting or being established. This article will review in more detail the rationale for the adjuvant use of bisphosphonates, the results of early trials, the progress of the later trials and the potential future role of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In addition, it is increasingly acknowledged that many cancer treatments have detrimental effects on bone and can increase the risk of fracture. The increasing use of aromatase inhibitors, in particular, will become a major cause of treatment-induced bone loss. This bone loss can be prevented with bisphosphonate treatment and this will also be discussed.",0
,The genetics of XX gonadal dysgenesis.,"In a nationwide population-based study of women born between 1950 and 1976, 75 patients with XX gonadal dysgenesis (XXGD) were identified in Finland. Patients were ascertained through hospital records and the registers of chromosome laboratories. In one family 4 daughters were affected; in six families 2 daughters were affected; and 57 cases were isolated. In one additional family the two affected females were in successive generations. Population records were utilized to trace ancestors of patients back to the beginning of the 19th century, in most cases. Consanguinity was detected in 8 (12%) of 66 families. When females only are considered, the segregation analyses yield a proportion of .23 affected. The relatively large number of affected individuals identified (incidence 1 in 8,300 live-born girls) implies a high gene frequency in the Finnish population. The geographic distribution was highly uneven, with most families originating in the sparsely populated north-central part of Finland. These findings support the existence of an autosomal recessive XXGD gene (locus designation ""ODG1"") that is highly enriched in Finland. The multiplex families already identified will make it possible to map the ODG1 gene by a random search for linkage by using polymorphic markers. Linkage-disequilibrium analysis in the sporadic patients will then be used to test for genetic homogeneity versus heterogeneity.",0

The antibiotic effect of the third generation of Cephalosporins against the said bacteria showed a tendency to decline. The susceptibility rate to Cefoperazone, Ceftazidime and Cefotaxime were respectively 71%, 66% and 79% in 1997; 47%, 25%, 39% in 1998; 22%, 16%, 25% in 2002; The third generation cephalosporins had almost lost their antibiotic activity against P. aeruginosa in 2003, with the susceptibility rate to Cefotaxime lowered to 2%. The susceptibility rate to Imipenem from 1997 to 2003 was 76%, 33%, 45%, 11%, 41%, 31%and 4%, respectively.The isolation rates of P. aeruginosa were steady during the period from 1997 to 1999, and they began to increase in 2000. The bacterial resistance to antibiotics increased gradually in recent years, and the strains of P. aeruginosa had become multi-drug resistant.",0

An antiserum raised against a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of melanosomes recognized a 65-kDa protein in melanocytes from mice homozygous for the buff mutation, but not in their wild type counterparts. Further studies were conducted using a specific, second generation antiserum raised against the purified protein. The protein was also detected in melanocytes cultured from albino mice, but absent in cultured mouse cell lines not of melanocyte origin. Density gradient centrifugation of subcellular organelles and indirect immunofluorescent cell staining, indicated that the protein was associated with melanosomes and vesicles. The protein on intact organelles could be made soluble using sodium carbonate, and digested with proteases in the absence of detergent suggesting that it was a peripheral membrane protein localized on the cytosolic face of organelle membranes. Metabolic labelling of cells and N-glycosidase F digestion of cell extracts indicated that the protein was not N-glycosylated. Based on its intracellular localization and biochemical defects in the buff mouse, a potential role has been suggested for the 65-kDa protein in intracellular membrane trafficking.",0

The role of vesicular transport and of canalicular events,"A number of organic anions selectively inhibit the biliary secretion of cholesterol and phospholipids without affecting bile acid secretion. We studied the effect of cefmetazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, on biliary lipid secretion in the rat. Injection of cefmetazole at a dose of 200 mumol/kg body wt. induced a choleretic effect and a significant decrease in the biliary output of cholesterol and phospholipid, without changes in bile acid secretion. The decrease was more marked for cholesterol than for phospholipid secretion, with a significant decrease in their molar ratio in bile. The effects were apparently unrelated to an inhibition of intracellular vesicular transport because, after injection of horseradish peroxidase, both the time course and total amount secreted of the protein did not significantly differ between control animals and those receiving cefmetazole. The secretory rate of the lysosomal marker acid phosphatase was not affected by cefmetazole administration. Biliary outputs of the plasma-membrane enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase were significantly decreased by the antibiotic. These results point to an effect of cefmetazole at the level of the canalicular membrane.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jgm.712,Tight control of transgene expression by lentivirus vectors containing second-generation tetracycline-responsive promoters,"The goal of this study was to design improved regulatable lentivirus vector systems. The aim was to design tetracycline (tet)-regulatable lentivirus vectors based on the Tet-on system displaying low background expression in the absence of the doxycycline (DOX) inducer and high transgene expression levels in the presence of DOX.We constructed a binary lentivirus vector system that is composed of a self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vector bearing inducible first- or second-generation tet-responsive promoter elements (TREs) driving expression of a transgene and a second lentivirus vector encoding a reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) that activates transgene expression from the TRE in the presence of DOX.We evaluated a number of different rtTAs and found rtTA2S-M2 to induce the highest levels of transgene expression. Regulated transgene expression was stable in human breast carcinoma cells implanted into nude mice for up to 11 weeks. In an attempt to minimize background expression levels, the chicken beta-globin cHS4 insulator element was cloned into the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) of the transgene transfer vector. The cHS4 insulator element reduced background expression but expression levels following DOX addition were lower than those observed with vectors lacking an insulator sequence. In a second strategy, vectors bearing second-generation TREs harboring repositioned tetracycline operator elements were used. Such vectors displayed greatly reduced leakiness in the absence of DOX and induced transgene expression levels were up to 522-fold above those seen in the absence of DOX.Inducible lentivirus vectors bearing insulators or second-generation TREs will likely prove useful for applications demanding the lowest levels of background expression.",0

We have done a review of the literature on the effectiveness and the cautions for prescription of risperidone, a second generation antipsychotic drug. Risperidone has proved helpful in treating children and adolescents with autism spectrum, conduct and bipolar disorders, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The principal side effects are sedation, weight gain, and metabolic disturbances.

Therefore, environmental toxicants through similar mechanisms can modulate biological systems to influence physiology and promote disease states. The majority of environmental toxicants do not have the capacity to modulate DNA sequence, but can alter the epigenome. In the event an environmental toxicant such as an endocrine disruptor modifies the epigenome of a somatic cell, this may promote disease in the individual exposed, but not be transmitted to the next generation. In the event a toxicant modifies the epigenome of the germ line permanently, then the disease promoted can become transgenerationaly transmitted to subsequent progeny. The current review focuses on the ability of environmental factors such as endocrine disruptors to promote transgenerational phenotypes.",1

They can also be multiple, and can be either acquired or congenital. Histopathologically glomus tumors are classified into three different variants: solid glomus tumor, glomangioma, and glomangiomyoma, which is the least frequent type. We report three instances of familial generalized multiple glomangiomyoma in a woman and her two children. Seven members of the family in two consecutive generations were affected, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. We performed a thorough clinical study, complete blood and platelet counts, stool for occult blood, karyotype, abdominal echography (which showed an asymptomatic solitary hepatic vascular lesion in one of the patients), gastrointestinal endoscopy, and skin biopsy with immunohistologic and ultrastructural studies. We believe that the terms glomangioma and glomangiomyoma actually designate the same lesion, with transitional areas from typical glomus cells to well-defined conventional smooth muscle cells. Although complete evaluation should be performed in all patients with multiple glomus tumors in order to detect possible occult systemic lesions, we only recommend treatment for symptomatic lesions.

Most teenage pregnancies occur among poor black and coloured South Africans. The majority of these pregnancies are said to be unwanted and unplanned and the teenager's relationships, unstable. Becoming a mother during one's teenage years is perceived to be socially, economically and physically deleterious for the teenager and her baby. This paper presents ethnographic data collected over a five-year period in the South African township of Nyanga East in the Western Cape. It draws attention to the circumstances that surround teenage pregnancy and discusses reactions to teenage pregnancies in this community. Findings highlight that despite the negative perception of teenage pregnancy within the township, particular social and cultural circumstances provided fertile ground for its occurrence. Furthermore, the paper argues that in this particular community the management of a teenage pregnancy played a functional and critical role in maintaining and reproducing social norms and ideals regarding intergenerational relationships, which ultimately ensured that the rates of early childbearing remained high.",0

To discover genes and processes in yeast that are required for growth when zinc is limiting, we used genome-wide functional profiling. Mixed pools of ∼4,600 deletion mutants were inoculated into zinc-replete and zinc-limiting media. These cells were grown for several generations, and the prevalence of each mutant in the pool was then determined by microarray analysis. As a result, we identified more than 400 different genes required for optimal growth under zinc-limiting conditions. Among these were several targets of the Zap1 zinc-responsive transcription factor. Their importance is consistent with their up-regulation by Zap1 in low zinc. We also identified genes that implicate Zap1-independent processes as important. These include endoplasmic reticulum function, oxidative stress resistance, vesicular trafficking, peroxisome biogenesis, and chromatin modification. Our studies also indicated the critical role of macroautophagy in low zinc growth. Finally, as a result of our analysis, we discovered a previously unknown role for the ICE2 gene in maintaining ER zinc homeostasis. Thus, functional profiling has provided many new insights into genes and processes that are needed for cells to thrive under the stress of zinc deficiency.",0

However, the assembly of DNA sequences to create a representation of the complete genome sequence remains costly, especially for the larger and more complex plant genomes. Results We have developed an online database, TAGdb, that enables researchers to identify paired read sequences that share identity with a submitted query sequence. These tags can be used to design oligonucleotide primers for the PCR amplification of the region in the target genome.

Despite the high degree of sequence similarity between the two domains, they differ in substrate and inhibitor specificity and in their activation by chloride ions. Because of the critical role of ACE in cardiovascular and renal diseases, both domains are attractive targets for drug design. Putative structural models have been generated for the interactions of ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captoril, enalaprilat, keto-ACE, ramiprilat, quinaprilat, peridoprilat, fosinoprilat, and RXP 407) with both the ACE_C and the ACE_N domains. Inhibitor-domain selectivity was interpreted in terms of residue alterations observed in the four subsites of the binding grooves of the ACE_C/ACE_N domains (S1: V516/N494, V518/T496, S2: F391/Y369, E403/R381, S1': D377/Q355, E162/D140, V379/S357, V380/T358, and S2': D463/E431, T282/S260). The interactions governing the ligand-receptor recognition process in the ACE_C domain are: a salt bridge between D377, E162, and the NH(2) group (P1' position), a hydrogen bond of the inhibitor with Q281, the presence of bulky hydrophobic groups in the P1 and P2' sites, and a stacking interaction of F391 with a benzyl group in the P2 position. In ACE_N these interactions are: hydrogen bonds of the inhibitor with E431, Y369, and R381, and a salt bridge between the carboxy group in the P2 position of the inhibitor and R500. The calculated complexes were evaluated for their consistency with structure-activity relationships and site-directed mutagenesis data. A comparison between the calculated interaction free energies and the experimentally observed biological activities was also made. Pharmacophore refinement was achieved at an atomic level, and might provide an improved basis for structure-based rational design of second-generation, domain-selective inhibitors.",0

Strains from infected pets originated from six European countries. Isolates were collected from urinary infections (Escherichia coli), respiratory infections (Pasteurella multocida), dermatological infections (Staphylococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and otitis (S. intermedius, P. aeruginosa). The MIC distribution for each species was the same both before and after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1995. In E. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin; this resistance was induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. Over this period, there was no significant evolution of MIC(90) for any bacterial species studied and no development of resistance was observed. Marbofloxacin was the most active antibiotic against P. multocida isolates and had the lowest MIC. No difference in MIC distribution was seen between the S. intermedius (unimodal distribution) isolated from dermatological infections and those from otitis. This was also true for P. aeruginosa. The use of marbofloxacin was not found to have induced a significant increase or spread of resistant bacteria.",0

The word 'Macht' [power], which is contained in the word 'Bemächtigung' points to Freud's difficult relationship with Alfred Adler, whose early theories on the aggressive drive and later theories on 'striving for power' were initially rejected by Freud. Looking at the changes in Freud's reception of Adlerian terms, some of which he later integrated into his own theory, throws light on his choice of the word 'Bemächtigungstrieb' in 1920, when he was just beginning to introduce his thoughts on the death instinct. A slightly different translation of the word 'Bemächtigungstrieb', one which takes these historical and theoretical aspects into account, could make these connections clearer for the English reader.",0

Older adults are often the most open to education and other forms of support when they need help in making a change or transition in their lives.

Matings were such that B complex alleles were segregated in the three experimental populations with minor exceptions. Each chicken was inoculated at 6 weeks of age with a subgroup of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Resulting tumors were subjectively scored on a scale from 0 (no tumor) to 6 (massive tumor) six times during a 10-week experimental period. Based upon the six tumor scores, each chicken was then assigned a tumor profile index (TPI), a criterion of antitumor response. The TPI were analyzed by least squares analysis of variance and corrected for hatch, sex, and virus prior to obtaining components of variance and estimates of heritability from a nested analysis of variance. Estimates of heritability from the sire component ranged from 0 to .41 +/- .27 and from the dam component .18 +/- .09 to .26 +/- .14, which are rather low estimates in general.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/7.6.959,Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice carrying CAG 45 alleles show trinucleotide repeat instability,"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Disease-associated alleles (37-66 CAGs) change in length when transmitted from parents to offspring, with a significantly greater tendency to shift size when inherited paternally. As transgenic mice carrying human AR cDNAs with 45 and 66 CAG repeats do not display repeat instability, we attempted to model trinucleotide repeat instability by generating transgenic mice with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) carrying AR CAG repeat expansions in their genomic context. Studies of independent lines of AR YAC transgenic mice with CAG 45 alleles reveal intergenerational instability at an overall rate of approximately 10%. We also find that the 45 CAG repeat tracts are significantly more unstable with maternal transmission and as the transmitting mother ages. Of all the CAG/CTG repeat transgenic mice produced to date the AR YAC CAG 45 mice are unstable with the smallest trinucleotide repeat mutations, suggesting that the length threshold for repeat instability in the mouse may be lowered by including the appropriate flanking human DNA sequences. By sequence-tagged site content analysis and long range mapping we determined that one unstable transgenic line has integrated an approximately 70 kb segment of the AR locus due to fragmentation of the AR YAC. Identification of the cis -acting elements that permit CAG tract instability and the trans -acting factors that modulate repeat instability in the AR YAC CAG 45 mice may provide insights into the molecular basis of trinucleotide repeat instability in humans.",0
https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2012.227371,Timing of inter-generational prevention of adiposity and type 2 diabetes,"Increasing evidence from animal studies, as well as from human epidemiological and physiological studies, supports the idea of adiposity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to be programmed at the earliest stages of life. This paradigm shift in our understanding of the origin of adiposity and T2D has been further substantiated by our recognition of the multiple known susceptibility genes to explain only a small proportion of the primary origin of these diseases. To this end, even intensified prevention programmes targeting adult life style factors have not been shown sufficiently effective to stop the global propagation of adiposity and T2D.  Studies of twins showed that the fetal environment associated with low birth weight (LBW) and zygosity status influence the risk of adiposity, insulin resistance, as well as glucose tolerance in adults in a non-genetic and age-dependent manner (Vaag & Poulsen, 2007). The consistent associations between LBW and markers of adiposity and T2D has intuitively been suspected to occur as a result of factors limiting growth per se during critical windows of fetal development. As fetal growth rates are highest during late pregnancy, much focus has been on factors operating during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Twins are born with lower birth weights than singletons, and recent evidence from sheep as well as from human studies have shown that twin status in itself may influence risk of adiposity and glucose intolerance with age (Poulsen et al. 2009). At the opposite end of the birth weight spectrum, studies have shown that a high birth weight associated with diabetes during pregnancy, including women with gestational diabetes (GDM) defined as incident (new) cases with diabetes being unmasked by insulin resistance during late pregnancy, seems also to be associated with increased adiposity and risk of T2D in the offspring. Accordingly, reduced fetal growth per se may not be the only answer to the question of the association between factors operating in pregnancy and risk of developing adiposity and T2D.  More recently, attention has been on a potential role of maternal diet influencing risk of adiposity and T2D at the time of conception in sheep (Rumball et al. 2008). The issue is further complicated by the report of the fathers diet at the time of conception influencing insulin secretion and, thus, potentially risk of T2D in the offspring (Ng et al. 2010).  The extent to which factors operating early as opposed to late in pregnancy may play a role for a lower fetal growth rate, as well as for an increased adiposity risk in twin sheep, is unknown. The study by Hancock et al. (2012) published in this issue of The Journal of Physiology randomized pregnant sheep with twin fetuses to either reduction of fetuses at day 42 of pregnancy, or a sham intervention mimicking the technical reduction procedure. A control group of singleton pregnancies was included too. The normal length of pregnancy in sheep is 148 days, and the study set-up was therefore well suited to examine the extent to which adverse nutritional exposures, or other factors operating during late pregnancy, might influence the outcome at birth according to weight or adiposity at age 2 years. Clearly, the study results pointed towards a key role of factors operating during the first 42 days of pregnancy. Thus, both birth weights as well as degree of adiposity at age 2 years was very similar to – or identical – among the reduction compared with the twin offspring. A slightly increased birth weight in the twin reductions compared with singleton lambs suggested that factors operating between day 42 and 148 in pregnancy may play some minor additional role for the impaired rate of fetal growth in sheep twin pregnancies.  Although the results from human and sheep twin studies add to the increasing awareness of the fetal environment playing a very important role for the risk of adiposity and T2D many decades later in life, it is important to note that the results simultaneously question the extent to which metabolic results from twin studies can explain mechanisms involved in the development of metabolic diseases in humans and animals born as singletons, including the mechanisms linking LBW with increased risk of T2D. For instance, the risk of T2D in twins is much lower than what would be expected if extrapolating the quantitative impact of LBW among singletons to twins (Vaag & Poulsen, 2007), why LBW in twins is not the same as LBW in singletons. Factors such as survival of the fittest during fetal life according to genetic constitution may also influence the extent to which results from twin studies may be extrapolated to singletons. Regardless, a major question of importance for understanding – and potentially in the future to prevent – metabolic diseases with a fetal developmental origin relates to the critical time window during development sensitive to adverse events influencing risk of adiposity and T2D later in life. Therefore, the paper by Hancock et al. is important as it, with an original and not previously seen approach, provides further proof-of-concept that unknown factors operating at the earliest periods of pregnancy influence both birth weight and risk of adiposity.  With the widespread acceptance of a fetal and developmental origin of adiposity and T2D in humans, possibly contributing significantly to the propagation of cardiometabolic diseases in developing countries transitioning over the last decades from being challenged by under-nutrition to being challenged by over-nutrition and physical inactivity, the crucial question arises of how and during which period of– or even before – pregnancy to implement prevention of adiposity and T2D for the generations to come. Failure to understand the importance of the timing of the physiological mechanisms underlying developmental programming of adiposity and T2D could result in massive losses of resources, if for instance, focusing inter-generational prevention initiatives on improving life style conditions in pregnant women during their last periods of pregnancy, when in fact the adverse developmental programming events had taken place during earlier periods of gestation, and perhaps already at the time of conception.  It may sound trivial, and to some eager public health-oriented professionals even disappointing, but there is no easy way to by-pass investments in further research addressing the basic physiology and molecular mechanisms, including the timing of events during pregnancy, underlying developmental programming of adiposity and T2D.",1

Method Survey questionnaires were mailed to all state hospital psychiatrists practising in South-Western France. Psychiatrists were asked to give information on the baseline metabolic screening of the last patient seen with first prescription of a SGAP. Adequacy of metabolic monitoring was assessed according to published guidelines. Results No metabolic parameter was assessed before SGAP onset in more than one out of four patients, and fewer than 5% had a complete baseline assessment of metabolic parameters. The number of parameters assessed was markedly lower in women compared to men. Conclusion Efforts should focus on initial training as well as on continuing medical education in order to improve level of awareness about the need for adequate baseline screening monitoring, and about the fact that women treated with SGAP are also at risk of metabolic disturbances.

We assessed the above in relation to adaptive shell morphology of the rocky intertidal snail Nucella lapillus by reciprocal transplantation of snails between two shores differing in wave action and rearing snails of the same provenance in a common garden. Results were compared with those reported for similar experiments conducted elsewhere. Microsatellite variation indicated limited gene flow between the populations. Intrinsic growth rate was greater in exposed-site than sheltered-site snails, but the reverse was true of absolute growth rate, suggesting heritable compensation for reduced foraging opportunity at the exposed site. Shell morphology of reciprocal transplants partially converged through plasticity toward that of native snails. Shell morphology of F(2)s in the common garden partially retained characteristics of the P-generation, suggesting genetic control. A maternal effect was revealed by greater resemblance of F(1)s than F(2)s to the P-generation. The observed synergistic effects of plastic, maternal and genetic control of shell-shape may be expected to maximise fitness when environmental characteristics become unpredictable through dispersal.",1

The base population was the F 2 generation of a cross between two inbred lines. Computer simulations of MAS were conducted for characters with dominance, epistasis and genotype-environment interaction approximated by the ‘additive-multiplicative’ model. MAS was more effective than purely phenotypic selection in all cases. The efficiency of MAS for characters with non-additive gene actionis comparable to (and for negative dominance even higher than) the efficiency of MAS for strictly additive characters. Environmental non-additivity, however, lowers the efficiency of MAS. Almost all results concerning the efficiency of MAS in our previoussimulations of purelyadditive traits are applicable to non-additive traits.",0

Little is known about the aggregation of ADHD in second-degree relatives. We examined the prevalence of ADHD in second-degree relatives of 140 ADHD probands and 120 normal controls. Information pertinent to the diagnosis of ADHD in second-degree relatives was collected from the probands' parents. The second-degree relatives of ADHD probands were at increased risk for ADHD compared with the second-degree relatives of normal control probands. These risks were greatest when the second-degree relative was biologically related to an ADHD parent of an ADHD proband. Consistent with the greater prevalence of ADHD among boys compared with girls, grandfathers were at greater risk than grandmothers and uncles were at greater risk than aunts. Our results support the usefulness of ascertaining information from second-degree relatives in studies evaluating the genetic epidemiology of ADHD. If confirmed, such studies may help clarify the mechanism of familial transmission of ADHD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.125.3.1271,Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping of Loci Influencing Elongation Factor 1α Content in Maize Endosperm,"Abstract The nutritional value of maize (Zea mays) seed is most limited by its protein quality because its storage proteins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). The Lys content of the kernel can be significantly increased by the opaque-2 mutation, which reduces zein synthesis and increases accumulation of proteins that contain Lys. Elongation factor 1α (eEF1A) is one of these proteins, and its concentration is highly correlated with the Lys content of the endosperm. We investigated the genetic regulation of eEF1A and the basis for its relationship with other Lys-containing proteins by analyzing the progeny of a cross between a high (Oh51Ao2) and a low (Oh545o2) eEF1A maize inbred. We identified 83 simple sequence repeat loci that are polymorphic between these inbreds; the markers are broadly distributed over the genome (1,402 cM) with an average interval of 17 cM. Genotypic analysis of the F2 progeny revealed two significant quantitative trait loci that account for 25% of the variance for eEF1A content. One of these is on the short arm of chromosome 4 and is linked with a cluster of 22-kD α-zein coding sequences; the other quantitative trait locus is on the long arm of chromosome 7. The content of α-zein and γ-zein was measured in pools of high- and low-eEF1A individuals obtained from this cross, and a higher level of α-zein was found to cosegregate with high eEF1A content. Allelic variation at the 22-kD α-zein locus may contribute to the difference of eEF1A content between Oh51Ao2 and Oh545o2 by increasing the surface area of protein bodies in the endosperm and creating a more extensive network of cytoskeletal proteins.",0
https://doi.org/10.2307/2061132,Immigration and the Stable Population Model,"This paper reports on work aimed at extending stable population theory to include immigration. its central findings is that, as long as fertility is below replacement, a constant number and age distribution of immigrants (with fixed fertility and mortality schedules) lead to a stationary population. Neither the level of the net reproduction rate nor the size of the annual immigration affects this conclusion; a stationary population eventually emerges. How this stationary population is created is studied, as is the generational distribution of the constant annual stream of births and of the total population. It is also shown that immigrants and their early descendants may have fertility well above replacement (as long as later generations adopt and maintain fertility below replacement), and the outcome will still be a long-run stationary population.",0

Cases were collected from a series of 286 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (HG-NHL) which, in the period September 1988 to August 1991, were enrolled in a prospective multicentre trial designed to compare the MACOP-B and F-MACHOP regimens. Immunostaining on frozen sections revealed a previously unrecognized phenotype, i.e. co-expression of B-cell (CD19, CD20, CD22, Ig-associated dimer) and activation-associated antigens (CD30 and CDw70) in about 60% of MLCL cases; in contrast, the activation-associated antigens CD25 and Ki-27 (unclustered) were consistently negative. This peculiar phenotype may reflect a derivation of the tumour from a subset of thymic activated B cells. Clinically, the patients (median age 31 years; F/M ratio 2.6) presented with bulky mediastinal mass (72%) associated with mediastinal syndrome in >50% cases; disease was stage IIA in most cases. All 18 patients received aggressive chemotherapy (F-MACHOP 11; MACOP-B 7). Complete response (CR) was achieved in 57.1% of cases treated with MACOP-B. In contrast, the response of the 11 MLCL treated with F-MACHOP was poor (CR 18.2%) as compared to that of the 135 HG-NHL treated with the same regimen during the trial (CR 69.6%). This difference was still statistically significant after adjusting for negative prognostic factors (mediastinal mass > 10 cm plus increased LDH) and suggests that F-MACHOP might not be the most appropriate regimen for this kind of lymphoma.",0

The Registry is an open observational study of the outcomes from endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Data have been contributed, on a voluntary basis, by 135 vascular centers from 18 European countries. Patients are registered prospectively, and data analysis is on an intention-to-treat basis. Results from the first generations of endograft were characterized by excellent early results but poor durability of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. EUROSTAR data have played a vital role in informing the technical evolution of subsequent generations of endograft and their clinical application. The latest data from EUROSTAR show significant improvements in all outcome measures, most importantly, those relating to durability. EUROSTAR has tracked and informed the evolution of EVAR. Improving results confirm that substantial progress has been made since 1996. EUROSTAR continues to contribute to this ongoing process.",0

In view of accruing evidence that head-and-neck cancers are causally related to alcohol and tobacco consumption, particularly in combination, it seems that the upsurge in consumption of alcohol and cigarettes after the 1939-45 war is now reflected in the increases in these two cancers, particularly in young women. The time-trends in sex-specific mortality from cancers of the larynx and oesophagus throughout this century, in both Britain and Australia, show strong correlations with alcohol consumption. By reference to inter-country differences in consumption trends, to differences in consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, to sex differences in cigarette consumption, to trends in types of alcoholic drink consumed, and to the mortality experienced of successive generations, the evidence that alcohol is causally related to laryngeal cancer is strengthened.",0

This change, primarily focused on rural production increment, was supported by the implementation of new production technologies, especially the use of chemical agents for crop protection and pest control. The impacts of the indiscriminate and extensive use of these chemical agents for actual and future generations of rural workers are indeterminate. Furthermore, it is hard to estimate the dimension of correlated environmental damages. In the present article, the role of pesticides use in rural production is discussed, contextualizing the local and regional rural production panorama and the impacts - economic, social, environmental and sanitary - of neo-liberal rural production policies.",0

One powerful approach for the genetic dissection of blood pressure regulation is studying inbred rat models of hypertension, as they provide natural allele variants but reduced heterogeneity (both genetic and etiologic). Furthermore, the detailed physiologic studies to which the rat is amenable allow for the determination of intermediate phenotypes. We have performed a total genome scan in offspring of an F2 intercross between the Lyon hypertensive (LH) and Lyon normotensive rat strains to identify linkage of anthropometric, blood pressure, renal, metabolic, and endocrine phenotypes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions involved in blood pressure regulation, end-stage organ damage, body and organ weight, and lipid metabolism in the LH rat were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, and 17, with 2 phenotypes associated with the metabolic syndrome identified on chromosomes 1 and 17. Regions on chromosomes 2, 13, and 17 were revealed to be important for blood pressure regulation. Regions on chromosome 17 were found to significantly contribute to both metabolic homeostasis and blood pressure regulation; 2 aggregates of a total of 23 QTLs were identified, including several ""intermediate phenotypes."" These intermediate phenotypes may be used as closer surrogates to the mechanisms leading to hypertension and metabolic dysfunction in the LH rat.",0

To overcome the problem of different CAG numbers found in each subject, also in the same family, the data were analyzed in terms of deviations from the average exponential relationship between onset and CAG number. The subject's year of birth was also considered to quantify possible sampling biases. Observations between relatives were compared with those of the whole group. The deviations were equal, on average, in subjects who inherited their HD gene from their fathers or mothers. Overall, our data argue in favor of a greater similarity across the same generation than across successive generations. In particular, an excess of parents with later than expected age of onset was observed, paralleled by a CAG-independent anticipation of onset in parent-child transmissions. These results can be interpreted in terms of a shared environment determining similar departures from the average CAG-onset relationship but also of a systematic effect that differentiates the two generations here examined.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-008-0016-1,Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) and Huntington’s disease-like 4 (HDL4),"Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) or Huntington’s disease-like-4 is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion above 44 units of a CAG/CAA repeat in the coding region of the TATA box binding protein (TBP) gene leading to an abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine stretch in the corresponding protein. Alleles with 43 and 44 repeats have been identified in sporadic cases and their pathogenicity remains uncertain. Furthermore, incomplete penetrance of pathological alleles with up to 49 repeats has been suggested. The imperfect nature of the repeat makes intergenerational instability extremely rare and de novo mutations are most likely the result of partial duplications. This is one of the rarer forms of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia but the associated phenotype is often severe, involving various systems (cerebral cortex, striatum, and cerebellum), with extremely variable age at onset (range: 3–75 years) and clinical presentation. This gene is thought to account for a small proportion of patients with a Huntington’s disease-like phenotype and cerebellar signs. Parkinson’s disease-like, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-like and Alzheimer disease-like phenotypes have also been described with small SCA17 expansions. The abnormal protein is expressed at the same level as its normal counterpart and forms neuronal intranuclear inclusions containing other proteins involved in protein folding or degradation. The increase in the size of the glutamine stretch enhances transcription in vitro, probably leading to transcription deregulation. Interestingly, the TBP protein mutated in SCA17 is recruited in the inclusions of other polyglutaminopathies, suggesting its involvement in the transcription down-regulation observed in these diseases.",0

From each of two genetic bases named E and F, which were derived from two commercial broiler stocks, a high incidence, low incidence, and a nonselected control strain were initiated. Selection of breeders to produce Generations 1 and 2 was based on the incidence of DMS in their parents after induced wing exercise; mass selection for plasma creatine kinase levels after induced wing exercise was used to produce Generation 3. Little genetic progress in selection occurred in Generations 1 and 2. There was a response in Generation 3, especially in Base E selected for low incidence. Heritability of incidence of DMS was estimated to be .48. Body weights at 8 weeks of age, 18 weeks of age, and breast angle at 18 weeks of age of Generation 3 were greater (P less than .05) for affected than nonaffected birds and positively correlated phenotypically with incidence of DMS. Genetic correlations were extremely variable. The higher incidence of DMS in birds with desirable traits suggests that the breeder must use a multitrait selection program to reduce incidence of DMS as well as improve production traits.",0

Cardiovascular symptoms are uncommon but in severe cases profound cardiovascular depression may occur.To report a case where extracorporeal circulatory support (ECCS) was used successfully in severe quetiapine overdose.A 40-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department (ED) with reduced consciousness apparently due to intoxication. She had a history of schizophrenia and was treated with 900 mg of quetiapine daily. In the ED, she presented with immeasurable low blood pressure, irregular bradycardia, hypothermia and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8. An immunoassay test for tricyclic antidepressive agents (TCA) was positive. Despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids, intensive vasopressor treatment and renal replacement therapy (CRRT) the patient's condition deteriorated. The patient was quickly moved to an intensive care unit where ECCS could be instituted. The patient subsequently recovered after 4 days in the ICU without any residual symptoms. Further laboratory analysis did not confirm the immunoassay finding.Severe poisoning with quetiapine may imitate tricyclic antidepressant poisoning, and drug screening methods may be falsely positive for TCA.

,"[Clinical and genetic consequences of ring chromosome, a structural genome mutation].","Ring chromosome is a peculiar genetic anomaly which may cause phenotypic abnormalities even without a loss of genetic material. The ring formation of chromosome ends induces difficulties in the sister chromatid separation at cell division, resulting in increased cell death rate through the generation of secondary aneuploid cells. Based on the in vitro analyses of own cases and a review of more than 200 case reports published in the literature, the author presents some conclusions on ""ring syndrome"", a non-specific clinical manifestation of ring formation of any chromosome, consisting of the lack of (or poorly expressed) organic manifestations, mild or borderline mental retardation, and a severe growth failure which is not explained by organic, biochemical, or endocrine findings. It is also suggested that the phenotypic manifestation of a ring chromosome is even less expressed when the ring is transmitted to the next generation. Based on observations of ring behaviour and the clinical phenotypes in a 3-generational family with a mosaic supernumerary ring, it is not unrealistic to assume that there is a transgenerational increase in the severity of the clinical manifestation resulting from a less efficient elimination process against the ring (cytogenetic anticipation).",0
,The effects of microgravity on the character of progeny of Drosophila melanogaster.,"To study how the microgravitational environment influences the character of the progeny of Drosophila melanogaster, the S1 insects produced during the 8-days of space flight were self-bred for four generations. Higher variational rate was found in S2. After removing the variant flies, the variational rate of the remaining Drosophila progeny decreased generation by generation. There was no notable sex-linked recessive lethal mutation of parent flies and no gene mutation found in their test-cross examination. It indicates that the germ-cell of parent adult flies were not much influenced by microgravity, but the embryo of filial generation bred in space were greatly influenced by microgravity. Therefore, the mutagenesis during the embryogenic development should be taken into account in the bio-breeding under the space microgravitational environment.",1

Differences in functioning between adult offspring of HS (HSO) and a comparison group, as well as the psychosocial functioning of adolescent grandchildren of HS, were studied. Degree of presence of Holocaust in the family was examined in families in which both parents were HSO, either mother or father was HSO, and neither parent was HSO. Mothers' Holocaust background was associated with higher levels of psychological distress and less positive parenting representations. In line with synergic (multiplicative) models of risk, adolescents in families where both parents were HSO perceived their mothers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, and reported less positive self-perceptions than their counterparts. They also perceived their fathers as less accepting and less encouraging independence, showed higher levels of ambivalent attachment style, and according to their peers, demonstrated poorer adjustment during military basic training than their fellow recruits from the one-parent HSO group. Parents and adolescents in the one-parent HSO group functioned similarly to others with no Holocaust background. Parenting variables mediated the association across generations between degree of Holocaust experience in the family of origin of the parents and ambivalent attachment style and self-perception of the adolescents. It is recommended that researchers and clinicians develop awareness of the possible traces of trauma in the second and the third generation despite their sound functioning in their daily lives.",1

Selection of chymotrypsin inhibitors from a conformationally-constrained combinatorial peptide library. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 819–827) we described a resin-bound cyclic peptide library, constructed based on the sequence of the anti-tryptic reactive site loop of Bowman–Birk Inhibitor (BBI), a proteinase inhibitor protein. This library was used to identify re-directed chymotrypsin inhibitors with Ki values as low as 17 nm. We have now extended this work by constructing an enhanced library in which a further position, at the P4 site of the inhibitor, has been randomized. This new library has variation at three target locations (P4, P1 and P2′) within the inhibitory loop region, producing 8000 variants. Screening this library allowed selection of new inhibitor sequences with Ki values as low as 3.4 nm. The success of this approach is reflected by the fact that the inhibition constant given by the selected peptide sequence is slightly lower than that reported against chymotrypsin for the most studied full length BBI protein, Soybean BBI 2-IV.

https://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod29.1.72,Ambient Temperature and Reproductive Success in Rodents Living at Different Latitudes 1,"The concern of this research was with the susceptibility of rodent reproduction to latitudinal acclimatization. More specifically, the relationship between ambient temperature and reproductive success was examined in house mice and deer mice whose ancestors had been trapped in northern versus southern climates (Alberta vs. Texas). Third generation adults of each of these four populations were paired and challenged to breed at -6 degrees, 3 degrees, 23 degrees or 34 degrees C. A 50-day period of gradual temperature adaptation preceded pairing. House mice, regardless of their geographic origin, were found to be relatively insensitive to extreme temperatures. Many pairs of both the Alberta and Texas stocks of this species still produced offspring when maintained at the experimental extremes of -6 degrees and 34 degrees C. In marked contrast, both northern and southern deer mice exhibited relatively narrow temperature ranges within which maximum breeding occurred: -6 degrees to 3 degrees for Texas deer mice and only at 23 degrees C for Alberta deer mice. Thus there is no evidence in either species that reproduction is either less sensitive to cold in northern latitudes or less sensitive to heat in southern latitudes; indeed, somewhat the reverse situation exists in deer mice. Evolutionarily, latitudinal considerations seem to have been of secondary rather than of primary importance in shaping the relationship between ambient temperature and reproduction in these two species.",0

The group of patients, suspected of PIT1 mutations, consisted of four familial cases (seven patients) and eight sporadic cases. All had complete GH deficiency and complete or partial Prl and TSH deficiency. Direct sequencing of all six exons of PIT1 and its promoter region showed a C to T transition mutation at codon 14 of exon 1 in a 3 8/12-year-old girl. This novel PIT1 mutation results in a proline to leucine substitution (P14L). The patient was heterozygous for mutant and normal alleles. The heterozygous P14L mutation was also present in her mother as well as in her maternal aunt and grandmother, all of whom were phenotypically normal. There was no mutation in the father's DNA, suggesting the need for reevaluation of genomic imprinting. In other children of our series, no mutation in PIT1 or in its promotor region was identified. This is the first report on the analysis of PIT1 and its promoter region in Russian children with GH/Prl/TSH deficiency. However, as the involvement of PIT1 mutation is rare in Russia, the other negative cases need to be analyzed for another candidate gene responsible for combined GH/Pr/TSH deficiency.",0

This study aimed to analyze psychosocial adaptation differences among three generations of recent Vietnamese immigrants, as well as to examine predictors of mental distress in the sample as a whole. A community sample of 184 recent Vietnamese immigrants, categorized as either elderly, middle-aged, or young adults, was assessed for levels of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as family conflict, dissatisfaction with life in the U.S., acculturation and biculturalism, social support, coping, and premigratory stressors. Young Vietnamese adults were most acculturated, most bicultural, and reported themselves as healthiest and least depressed. They were most often working, least often on welfare, and had the highest family income. However, they also reported most dissatisfaction with their current lives in the U.S. and most family conflict. Regression analysis explaining approximately one-quarter of the variance in mental distress implicated current dissatisfaction with and lack of adjustment of life in the United States, as well as greater acculturation and increased family conflict. Although young adults scored significantly higher than other generations on most of the risk factors for psychological distress, they appeared to be buffered against poorer mental health outcomes by factors of generation and perceived positive overall well-being. In terms of testing a predictive model of psychological distress, this study found current adjustment factors significantly more important in determining mental health outcomes than premigratory stressors such as war-related traumas.",1

However, the expression profile of β2 and β4 subunits overlap in a variety of tissues including locus ceruleus, retina, hippocampus, dorsal root ganglia, and adrenal chromaffin cells. Ligands that bind α6β2 nAChRs also potently bind the closely related α6β4 subtype. To distinguish between these two subtypes, we synthesized novel analogs of a recently described α-conotoxin, PeIA. PeIA is a peptide antagonist that blocks several nAChR subtypes, including α6/α3β2β3 and α6/α3β4 nAChRs, with low nanomolar potency. We systematically mutated PeIA and evaluated the resulting analogs for enhanced potency and/or selectivity for α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (α6/α3 is a subunit chimera that contains the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of the α6 subunit). On the basis of these results, second-generation analogs were then synthesized. The final analog, PeIA[S9H,V10A,E14N], potently blocked acetylcholine-gated currents mediated by α6/α3β2β3 and α6/α3β4 nAChRs with IC(50) values of 223 pM and 65 nM, respectively, yielding a >290-fold separation between the two subtypes. Kinetic studies of ligand binding to α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs yielded a k(off) of 0.096 ± 0.001 min(-1) and a k(on) of 0.23 ± 0.019 min(-1) M(-9).

One was severely affected by Mn and the other was only moderately affected. Various regions in the brains of the neonates were subjected to histochemical examination under a light microscopy. The losses of stainability in granular cells in the external layer of the cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, and the increase in stainability of the nerve fibers in the cerebellar medulla were in parallel to the degree of abnormal movement in the gait; the greater loss or gain in stainability, varying according to the regions, was associated with the more severe damages to motion. Meanwhile, the changes in the stainabilities of nerve cell nuclei in the lamellar structure of cerebral motor areas and the Nissl bodies in the cerebral medulla were already maximal in the moderately affected neonate. These results indicate that the Mn effect covers a broad area of the extrapyramidal tract even though there are some differences in the sensitivity to Mn in different regions.",1

https://doi.org/10.1159/000209976,The Role of Epigenetics in Mediating Environmental Effects on Phenotype,"Epigenetics is being suggested as a possible interface between the genetic and environmental factors that together give rise to phenotype. In mice there exists a group of genes, known as metastable epialleles, which are sensitive to environmental influences, such as diet, and undergo molecular changes that, once established, remain for the life of the individual. These modifications are epigenetic and in some cases they survive across generations, that is, through meiosis. This is termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. These findings have led to the idea that similar processes might occur in humans. Although it is clear that the lifestyle of one generation can significantly influence the health of the next generation in humans, in the absence of supporting molecular data it is hard to justify the notion that this is the result of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. What is required first is to ascertain whether genes of this type, that is genes that are sensitive to the epigenetic state, even exist in humans.",1

Thelargest increase occurred in the oldest age-groups. The proportion ofpatients with transitional cell carcinoma increased in menfrom66.0 percent in1960-64 to 93.6 percent in 1990-93 and in women from 61.0 percent to 89.4percent. The proportion of patients with papillomas decreased, whereas thosewith adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were stable. Regressionmodeling (based on the period 1960-89) showed a strong linear effect due toeither period and/or cohort. Among men, additional non-linear effects by bothperiod and cohort were obtained. T he cohort effects were more important.Cohort data on having smoked daily showed considerable similarities with theestimated cohort-effects. Our findings suggest that the increase of tobaccosmoking in successive generations can explain the increase in incidence ratesof bladder cancer in Sweden, whereas improved diagnostic activities andregistration are less likely to explain fully the changes in incidence rates.",0
https://doi.org/10.2307/3282179,Laboratory Selection of Haemonchus contortus for Resistance to Ivermectin,"The eighth generation of adult Haemonchus contortus, selected by subjecting infected pairs of sheep to suboptimal ivermectin treatment once per generation from parent (P; BBH isolate) through F7 (IV-A; selected isolate), required an approximate 4-fold increase in the ivermectin dose to produce 95% efficacy compared with its contemporary parent isolate. In a dose titration experiment the dose-response curve of the drug pressure-derived isolate, IV-A, was significantly (0.02 less than P less than 0.05) less steep than was the response curve of the parent, BBH, isolate. Potency estimates based upon these nonparallel dose-response curves would not remain constant over a range of efficacy levels but would decrease rapidly at efficacies greater than 95%. Passage of a closed population of the F8 generation of IV-A sequentially through pairs of sheep for an additional 11 generations (F8A-F8K) without additional drug pressure being applied produced no reversion to sensitivity to ivermectin relative to the F7 generation, thus suggesting that the selected ""resistance"" was stable.",0
https://doi.org/10.1042/ba20090274,Affinity maturation of a TNFα-binding Affibody molecule by Darwinian survival selection,"The introduction of different methodologies for the construction and screening of complex protein libraries has provided powerful means in protein engineering for the development of molecules with desired traits. A challenge faced in many situations is to adapt a given methodology for efficient and rapid identification of the most interesting variants present in a library. In the present study, the concept of Darwinian selection based on a growth advantage for clones having the desired trait has been investigated. Using a beta-lactamase-based PCA (protein fragment complementation assay), affinity maturation of a TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha)-binding Affibody molecule with an initial 2 nM affinity for the target has been performed. Initial characterization of the PCA system, based on the affinity-driven reconstitution of beta-lactamase activity in the periplasm of cells harbouring a library member showing affinity for a co-expressed target protein, showed that the system was responsive to promoter induction level, interaction affinity and applied selection pressure. Using combinatorial protein engineering principles, a 107 library of second-generation Affibody molecules was constructed and subjected to selection of improved variants by library growth in liquid culture. The results show that, after a pre-selection step on semi-solid medium to eliminate non-binding variants, present in the majority, two rounds of selection in liquid culture resulted in an enrichment for binders showing up to 8-fold higher affinity for the TNFalpha target than the ancestral variant. Biosensor analyses showed that the major factor for the improved affinity could be attributed to reduced off-rate constants.",0
,"""I know what I'm facing"".","By May 1991, 6700 reported cases of AIDS existed in Zimbabwe and many included those in the labor force. Around 25% of the cases were infants. Moreover about 500,000 may actually have been HIV seropositive with an estimated 90% being of working age for an HIV seroprevalence of about 10% in the labor force. 50% of the 10 million inhabitants of Zimbabwe were 15 years old. In 1990, 18% of 1000 pregnant women screened in Harare were HIV positive. Furthermore, 51% of patients screened at an urban genitourinary clinic in 1990 tested HIV positive whereas, in 1987, only 18% tested HIV positive. The extended family can no longer cope with the problems created by the AIDS epidemic, so the community must support HIV positive people and AIDS patients. For example, grandparents or other relatives must often take in the children of parents who have died from AIDS. Indeed, the emotional turmoil in learning of one's own or a loved one's HIV infection can be overwhelming. The Ministry of Health has founded the AIDS Control Programme which includes counseling as an important component. This division trains health workers in counseling individuals and families afflicted with AIDS and provides pamphlets for primary health care workers. 1 thing that it emphasizes is that clients need time to deal with the situation. Yet many health workers do not have the time. More and continued integration between social workers and health providers is needed. A woman from the AIDS Counselling Trust suggests that counseling for mothers of infants with AIDS can begin with a small group in hospital wards, such as what has been done in Mutare, Zimbabwe. Further self help groups can be connected with clinics. Zimbabwe can also go the way of Zambia and provide home based care services and mobile units.",0
,Validation of a new whole blood coagulation monitoring system.,"The Hemochron Response is a third generation point-of-care (POC) whole blood coagulation analyzer that retains the clinical utility of the Hemochron standard (801/8000) while providing a data management program that assists the POC coordinator with Quality Assurance (QA) compliance. Clinical and laboratory studies were performed to ensure consistency of the target anticoagulation times with the Hemochron standard and to evaluate precision and reproducibility of the Hemochron Response. Clinical tests for prothrombin time (PT) using fresh and citrated whole blood, activated clotting time (ACT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) showed excellent correlation to the Hemochron standard where r = 0.929, r = 0.969, r = 0.947, and r = 0.992, respectively. This was confirmed by a paired Student's t-test. The standard expectation for reproducibility of ACT tests has been a coefficient of variation (CV) of 10%. Laboratory studies of reproducibility and precision for the Response instrument included analysis of the CV using ACT test tubes. For normal and abnormal control plasma (CPL), the range of CVs observed was 3.3%-4.6% and 3.0%-5.0%, respectively. For heparin dose response analysis, the range for Donor 1 and 2 was 1.0%-4.2% and 1.1%-8.0%, respectively. These data suggest that the Hemochron Response is reliable and equivalent to the Hemochron standard in clinical applications.",0

Yet most studies to date have focused on mortality and additional data on morbidity outcomes are needed. Additionally, most research in this area has been conducted in Northern European countries or in the United States, and less is known about the extent of socioeconomic inequalities in health in other industrialized countries with different health and labour market characteristics. In this study, we examined the relationship between the socioeconomic trajectory from childhood to adulthood and functional limitations in midlife in France. We used data from a nationally-representative sample of French men and women conducted in 2002-2003 (the Life History survey). Participants (n = 4798) were 35-64 years of age at the time of the survey. standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) associated with different lifelong trajectories were estimated using indirect age standardization. Overall, the socioeconomic trajectory from childhood to adulthood was associated with functional limitations in midlife in both men and women. The experience of lifelong socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with SMRs of 1.44, p < 0.0001 in men and 1.21, p = 0.0207 in women. In men, the prevalence of functional limitations was low among those who experienced upward intergenerational mobility and high among those who experienced a downward trajectory during the course of their professional career. Additionally, the prevalence of functional limitations was elevated among men and women who experienced unemployment. These findings indicate that in French men and women, lifetime socioeconomic circumstances are associated with functional limitations in midlife. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these health disparities will require additional studies of specific health outcomes.",0

We studied the genetic architecture of virus transmission by crossing a vector and a non-vector genotype of S. graminum. F1 and F2 hybrids were generated, and a modified line-cross biometrical analysis was performed on transmission phenotype of two of the viruses that cause barley yellow dwarf: Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV)-RPV and Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)-SGV. Our aims were to (1) determine to what extent differences in transmission ability between vectors and non-vectors is due to net additive or non-additive gene action, (2) estimate the number of loci that determine transmission ability and (3) examine the nature of genetic correlations between transmission of CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV. Only additive effects contributed significantly to divergence in transmission of both CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV. For each luteovirus, Castle-Wright's estimator for the number of effective factors segregating for transmission phenotype was less than one. Transmission of CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV was significantly correlated in the F2 generation, suggesting that there is a partial genetic overlap for transmission of these luteoviruses. Yet, 63% of the F2 genotypes transmitted CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV at significantly different rates. Our data suggest that in S. graminum, the transmission efficiency of both CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV is regulated by a major gene or set of tightly linked genes, and the transmission efficiency of each virus is influenced by a unique set of minor genes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.59.2.229,THE RELATION OF COAT COLOR TO THE SPONTANEOUS INCIDENCE OF MAMMARY TUMORS IN MICE,"1. The material included in this paper consists of F1 and F2 virgin female mice derived from a cross between a strain high in mammary cancer incidence (dilute brown) and one relatively low in incidence of mammary cancer but relatively high in the incidence of various internal tumors (yellow). 2. In the F1 and F2 hybrid generations the yellow animals have a significantly lower incidence of mammary tumors than do the non-yellows. This is the first clear case of a difference in the incidence of spontaneous tumors in mice associated with a color difference. 3. Mammary tumors occur, however, significantly earlier in the yellow mice and are just as malignant as those appearing in the non-yellows. 4. The incidence of tumors other than mammary is not significantly different in the yellow and non-yellow hybrids. Such tumors, however, occur distinctly later in life than do the mammary tumors. This provides additional evidence that, in mice, mammary tumors cannot be considered to be the same biological phenomenon as are other types of tumor. 5. A study of the physiology of reproduction of yellow and non-yellow mice within the yellow stock suggests that the yellows pass through their reproductive cycle earlier than do the non-yellows. The duration of the cycle in the two forms is essentially equal. This fact would satisfactorily explain the earlier incidence of mammary tumors in yellow mice. 6. The lower incidence of mammary tumors in yellows as compared with non-yellows may be at least in part due to the same phenomenon. This would follow because the opportunity for mammary tissue in yellow mice of cancer age to be continuously affected by ovarian secretion would be less than in non-yellows. This would result in a higher percentage of yellows reaching an age at which stimuli from the ovary ceased before the mammary tissue had reached an age at which tumor formation is most frequent. 7. There is some evidence that, in this cross, dilute (dbdb) mice are less apt to form mammary tumors than are intensely pigmented animals. This point, however, needs further investigation before it can be considered to be established. 8. The facts recorded in this paper demonstrate that not all forms of tumor or all colors of mice can be lumped together in studying either the physiology or genetics of spontaneous tumor incidence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/mutage/16.1.17,Heritable effects of paternal irradiation in mice on signaling protein kinase activities in F3 offspring,"We evaluated F3 mouse offspring from paternal F0 attenuated 137Cs gamma-irradiation (1.0 Gy) for heritable effects on gene products that can modulate cell proliferation rate and that may be markers for genomic instability. The F3 generation was selected for evaluation as a stringent test for heritability of effects from paternal F0 germline irradiation. Male CD1 mice were bred 6 weeks after irradiation so that the fertilizing sperm were type B spermatogonia at the time of irradiation. The resulting F1 males were bred to CD1 females to produce F2 four-cell embryos. The F2 embryos with a radiation history were paired with 'control' CD1 four-cell embryos that were heterozygous for the neo transgene. These F2 XY-XY chimeras, consisting of cells derived from both an embryo with a paternal F0 radiation history and a control embryo, were transferred to foster mothers, raised to adulthood and bred to produce F3 offspring. F3 offspring were evaluated for hepatic activities of receptor tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and MAP kinase and for protein levels of nuclear p53 and p21(waf1). All three protein kinase activities were altered and nuclear levels of p53 and p21(waf1) protein were higher in the group of offspring that included F3 offspring with a paternal F0 radiation history than in littermates in the neo-positive control group. To our knowledge, this is the first observation in the descendants of paternal germline irradiation of effects on signal protein kinase activities and downstream nuclear target proteins that can influence cell proliferation rates.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.20648,How many populations set foot through the Patagonian door? Genetic composition of the current population of Bahía Blanca (Argentina) based on data from 19 Alu polymorphisms,"The city of Bahía Blanca occupies a strategic place in Argentina south of the Pampean region in the north-east corner of the Patagonia. Since 1828, this city has been the historical and political border between Amerindian lands in the south, and the lands of European colonists. Nowadays, Bahía Blanca is an urban population mainly composed by descendents of immigrants from Spain and other European countries with apparently low admixture with Amerindians. In view of the unexpectedly high Amerindian admixture levels (about 46.7%) suggested by mtDNA data, and protein markers (19.5%), we analyzed a set of 19 Alu polymorphisms (18 autosomal, 1 of Chromosome Y) in a well-documented genealogical sample from Bahía Blanca. The genotyped sample was made up of 119 unrelated healthy individuals whose birth place and grandparent origins were fully documented. According to available genealogical records, the total sample has been subdivided into two groups: Bahía Blanca Original (64 individuals with all 4 gandparents born in Argentina) and Bahía Blanca Mix (55 individuals with one to three grandparents born out of Argentina). Allele frequencies and gene diversity values in Bahía Blanca fit well into the European ranges. Population relationships have been tested for 8 Alu markers, whose variation has been described in several Amerindian and European samples. Reynolds genetic distances underline the significant genetic similarity of Bahía Blanca to Europeans (mean distance 0.044) and their differentiation from Amerindians (0.146). Interestingly enough, when the general sample is divided, Bahía Blanca Original appears slightly closer to Amerindians (0.127) in contrast to Bahía Blanca Mix (0.161). Furthermore, the genetic relationships depicted through a principal components analysis emphasize the relative similarity of Bahía Blanca Original to Amerindians. A thorough knowledge of the sample origins has allowed us to make a subtle distinction of the genetic composition of Bahía Blanca.",0

The framework of this study is sociocultural, with an emphasis on family reminiscing as contributing to early memories. In this regard Italy is of interest due to the fact that it is a Western but familial oriented culture, where multi-generational family ties are still strong in comparison with other European counterparts, providing for the opportunity to investigate the offset of childhood amnesia as a function of growing up in an extended family structure. Consistent with Mullen (1994), 90 undergraduate students were interviewed about their earliest memory and about sociodemographic factors in their early childhood years: household composition, gender, birth order, presence of family moves, and significant early childhood experiences. Participants who grew up in an extended family situation reported earlier and denser memories in comparison with those from nuclear families. Results are discussed in light of other cross-cultural work on childhood amnesia and with respect to sociocultural theories of the importance of family reminiscing for one's early memories.",0

Several substituents were introduced in the aromatic rings to evaluate the influences of electronic and steric interactions in their binding to the DAT. All the novel analogs showed preferential interaction at the DAT compared with the SERT. Different aromatic substitutions in the phenyl ring of the N-benzyl part of the molecule played a key role in the selectivity. In general, compounds with strong electron-withdrawing substituents were most active and selective at the DAT. Thus, compounds 5a (R = F) and 11b (R = NO2) were among the most potent (IC50 = 17.2 and 16.4 nM, respectively) and most selective (SERT/DAT = 112 and 108, respectively) and were far more selective than GBR 12909 (SERT/DAT = 6). Bioisosteric replacement of one of the phenyl rings of the diphenylmethoxy moiety by a thiophene ring was tolerated well and produced the most potent compound 13b (IC50 = 13.8 nM) in the series. Our current structure−activity studies of these piperidine analogs resulted in the generation of second generation of GBR-type compounds, and all of these new compounds reported here were more selective than GBR 12909 in interacting with the DAT over the SERT.",0

[corrected].","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and progressive β cell failure; therefore, β cell secretagogues are useful for achieving sufficient glycemic control. Glimepiride is a second-generation sulfonylurea that stimulates pancreatic β cells to release insulin. Additionally, is has been shown to work via several extra pancreatic mechanisms. It is administered as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom glycemic control is not achieved by dietary and lifestyle modifications. It can also be combined with other antihyperglycemic agents, including metformin and insulin, in patients who are not adequately controlled by sulfonylureas alone. The effective dosage range is 1 to 8 mg/day; however, there is no significant difference between 4 and 8 mg/day, but it should be used with caution in the elderly and in patients with renal or hepatic disease. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain compared to other sulfonylureas. Glimepiride use may be safer in patients with cardiovascular disease because of its lack of detrimental effects on ischemic preconditioning. It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, post-prandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.",0

On the basis of a superior efficacy in combination with a lower toxicity, the triazoles have superseded the older azoles. Regularly, amphotericin B and a triazole are used simultaneously without any evidence from clinical trials that such a strategy is safe and efficacious. Liposomal preparation, lipid complex or colloidal dispersion of amphotericin B have been produced successfully to reduce toxicity. However, there is only one small randomised study that hints at the superiority of liposomal amphotericin B over amphotericin B deoxycholate. Promising new agents like candins, sordarins, high dose oral terbinafine, the third generation azoles, and liposomal nystatin are under development. The first phase II study on voriconazole in the treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis has produced encouraging results. The major promise of the new candins lies in the activity against Candida species, including those resistant to the azoles and polyenes, and in a mechanism of action totally different from the established antifungals. Cytokines and colony stimulating factors are theoretically very promising but there are no clinical studies that warrant routine use.",0

Its early detection allows for adequate treatment and follow-up, with minimum consequences. Family involvement must be taken into consideration, and any kind of improper relationship should be evaluated and treated, so that it can be discouraged and eliminated; otherwise, intergenerational abuse will result and probably recur. The identification of domestic violence and of physical and psychological warning signs concerning sexual abuse is part of the general evaluation.Pediatricians should be able to identify the signs and symptoms sexually abused children and adolescents carry with them. They have to listen carefully to the patients, perform the necessary clinical examination and establish the proper treatment. They should also be able to deal with psychological aspects and have enough knowledge about the laws and about legal and social protection measures, which are always very useful in assisting victims of sexual violence.",0

The importance of such a discussion is to provide both the novice and the experienced nurse with additional knowledge of this current health issue with which to inform their nursing practice.The potential for psychosis to be a chronic condition is very high, and often people require antipsychotic medicine for lengthy periods throughout their lives. Sometimes, treatment is for life. The second generation of antipsychotic medicines was greeted with much enthusiasm since it was better tolerated than the first generation. However, each medication has desired and adverse effects and, when taken for lengthy periods, these effects may produce physical illness. Studies show that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in clients with a chronic psychiatric disorder, particularly schizophrenia.Metabolic instability, especially weight gain, is associated with some psychotropic medicines. Nursing interventions need to include care assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation for clients treated with antipsychotic medicines in terms of risk minimization strategies in routine nursing care.",0

There is a constant increase in the proportion of women newly infected with HIV in the global population; this increase is particularly high in some areas of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa. Microbicides are products that are being developed to empower women against HIV. First- and second-generation microbicides are broad-spectrum products that include surface active agents, vaginal defense enhancers, and blocking agents. Third-generation microbicides are HIV-specific and include replication and entry inhibitors formulated as gels or as vaginal rings. However, there is a concern that antiretroviral-based microbicides could lead to drug resistance if they are used by HIV-positive women who are unaware of their HIV status. To reach the highest number of women possible, microbicides should be available over-the-counter, which might not be the case with antiretroviral-based formulations. In contrast, non-antiretroviral-based microbicides will have the advantage of being initiated and controlled by women themselves and they will not jeopardize the use of life-saving drugs.",0
,Performance of the Roche second generation hemoglobin A1c immunoassay in the presence of HB-S or HB-C traits.,"Blood HbA1c determination is a powerful tool for the evaluation and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. Many HbA1c analytical methods demonstrate bias in samples from patients with hemoglobinopathies. This study evaluated the analytical performance of Roche Diagnostics' 1st and 2nd generation HbA1c assays in patients with or without hemoglobinopathies whose HbA1c levels were elevated or normal, respectively. Boronate-affinity high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) served as the reference method. Whole blood samples were collected from 80 patients with HbS or HbC whose group mean HbA1c value was elevated and also from 80 patients without hemoglobinopathy whose HbA1c values were in the well-controlled range. Each sample was assayed for HbA1c by the Primus boronate-affinity HPLC technique and by Roche's 1st and 2nd generation immunoassays using a Cobas Integra 800 analytical system. Results by the HPLC technique were compared with the results of both Roche assays by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. The 1st and 2nd generation assays yielded regression lines and correlation values vs HPLC assay of y = 1.43x - 1.59; R(2) = 0.83, and y = 0.94x + 0.10; R(2) = 0.92, respectively, in the 80 patients with hemoglobinopathies. The mean difference and the +/-2SD range were greater in the 1st than in the 2nd generation assay (2.68, +/-2.07 vs -0.54, +/-0.86, respectively). The 2nd generation assay also showed better performance than the 1st generation assay in samples from the 80 patients without hemoglobinopathy. In conclusion, this study validates the accuracy of Roche's 2nd generation assay, which is substantially improved over Roche's 1st generation HbA1c assay.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-010-1329-2,High-throughput identification of genetic markers using representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis,"We describe a novel approach for high-throughput development of genetic markers using representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis. We test the performance of the method in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) as a model for crop plants with little sequence information available. Genomic representations of both parents of a mapping population were hybridized on microarrays containing in total 146,554 custom made oligonucleotides based on sugar beet bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Oligonucleotides showing a signal with one parental line only, were selected as potential marker candidates and placed onto an array, designed for genotyping of 184 F(2) individuals from the mapping population. Utilizing known co-dominant anchor markers we obtained 511 new dominant markers (392 derived from BAC end sequences, and 119 from ESTs) distributed over all nine sugar beet linkage groups and calculated genetic maps. Further improvements for large-scale application of the approach are discussed and its feasibility for the cost-effective and flexible generation of genetic markers is presented.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1993.18010144.x,A multi-generational staff development model for registered nurses,"The paper focuses on a significant nursing initiative for staff development undertaken in South Australia. The initiative arose out of Health Commission funded consultancy which sought to develop a staff development model for registered nurses. The outcome of this consultancy was the development of a multi-generational staff development model, known as the DPS Staff Development Model. This model provides a framework through which staff development activities can be analysed, consolidated and extended. The paper outlines the DPS Staff Development Model, the context in which it was developed and its implications for nursing staff development programmes. The development of the model was premised on a number of assumptions. These included the need to ensure flexibility, longevity, offer a perspective of staff development that is realistic and practical, and facilitate in registered nurses a sense of ownership and personal responsibility with respect to their development. The model comprises six broad areas of focus: the Career Development Model for registered nurses in South Australia, the structure of the model, locations in which staff development occurs, elements which assist in maintaining skills and knowledge, elements which enhance growth and development and the processes and relationships necessary for the successful implementation of staff development programmes.",0

Les données utilisées proviennent du fichier de population BALSAC (Institut interuniversitaire de recherches sur les populations, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi). L'analyse est basée sur une comparaison entre la reproduction (nombre d'enfants et âge à la maternité) des mères nées dans la région du Saguenay entre 1850 et 1880 et celle de leurs enfants (filles et garçons). Les résultats obtenus montrent qu'il existe une relation positive d'une génération à l'autre en ce qui a trait au nombre d'enfants ainsi qu'à l'âge à la naissance du premier enfant.",1
,Third-generation cephalosporins: a review.,"Third-generation cephalosporins play a pivotal role in the management of infections because of their potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, proven clinical efficacy in a wide variety of infections, safety, and potential for cost savings. Selection of third-generation cephalosporins poses a dilemma, however, particularly for clinicians who view the six antibiotics within this class as interchangeable. Choice of drug should be based on antimicrobial spectrum and other factors such as lack of resistance development and cost considerations. This review focuses on the distinguishing features of the parenteral third-generation cephalosporins. Such differences suggest the need for retiring the convenient ""generation"" classification system for cephalosporins in favor of a system that encourages recognition of clinically important features of each agent in this diverse group of cephalosporin antibiotics.",0
https://doi.org/10.2337/diabetes.53.suppl_3.s151,Kinetics-Effect Relations of Insulin-Releasing Drugs in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"Sulfonylureas and glinides have similar mechanisms of action but differ in receptor affinity and binding sites and in absorption and elimination rates. This promotes differences in potency, rate of onset, and duration of action. While prominent in single-dose studies, these differences have less importance during long-term sulfonylurea treatment: at ordinary dosages, rapid- and short-acting (glipizide) and slow- and long-acting (glyburide) sulfonylureas maintained continuously effective plasma levels and similar 24-h glucose control. Moreover, there was no difference in patient outcome between the first-generation sulfonylurea chlorpropamide and the second-generation glyburide in the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study. However, the risk of long-lasting and hence dangerous hypoglycemia is higher with these two long-acting sulfonylureas. Conversely, this risk should be low with the short-acting glinides, but seemingly at the expense of less effective glucose control. The most important kinetics-effect relations are that hyperglycemia delays sulfonylurea absorption and that the sulfonylurea dose-response curve is bell shaped; continuous sulfonylurea exposure over a certain level (e.g., 10 mg glipizide) impairs rather than improves insulin and glucose responses to sulfonylurea (downregulation). Accordingly, a vicious circle may be established: unrelenting hyperglycemia may promote sulfonylurea dose increase, which increases hyperglycemia, promoting further dose increase and eventually therapeutic failure.",0

In this review, we describe the role of behavioral analysis in facilitating cross-level integration. Modern sound analysis approaches allow investigation of developmental song learning across multiple time scales. Combined with novel methods that allow experimental control of vocal changes, it is now possible to test hypotheses about mechanisms of vocal learning. Further, song analysis can be done at the population level across generations to track cultural evolution and multigenerational behavioral processes. Complementing the investigation of song development with noninvasive brain imaging technology makes it now possible to study behavioral dynamics at multiple levels side by side with developmental changes in brain connectivity and in auditory responses.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10428194.2010.516378,European Myeloma Network: the 3rd Trialist Forum Consensus Statement from the European experts meeting on multiple myeloma,"Over the past two decades, not only treatment options, but also the diagnosis, staging, and risk assessment of multiple myeloma (MM), have undergone significant development, partially due to a deeper understanding of MM pathogenesis. Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization are routinely assessed in MM, and when combined with ISS stage may attain an even better predictive potential. In order to achieve even more effective and individualized therapies, one crucial goal is the identification of genes and gene combinations that predict for response or resistance to chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) still remains the standard therapy for younger patients, with novel agents now being included in both pre-transplant regimens and post-transplant consolidation/maintenance approaches. Similarly, novel agents are also being incorporated into allogeneic SCT for selected patients. In the treatment of elderly patients with MM, novel agents have been successfully incorporated into less intensive regimens, including melphalan/prednisone, low-dose dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone. While second-generation proteasome inhibitors are currently being intensively investigated, the subcutaneous administration of bortezomib, being equivalent to the established i.v. route, is now entering clinical practice. Supportive care remains a crucial aspect in the management of MM. The European Myeloma Network Trialist Group aims to address these contemporary aspects in MM.",0

However, pharmacological interrogation of Eph kinase function has been hampered by a lack of potent and selective Eph kinase inhibitors. Here we report the discovery of compounds 6 and 9 using a rationally designed kinase-directed library which potently inhibit Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly EphB2 with cellular EC(50)s of 40nM. Crystallographic data of EphA3 and EphA7 in complex with the inhibitors show that they bind to the 'DFG-out' inactive kinase conformation and provide valuable information for structure-based design of second generation inhibitors.",0

Ophthalmoscopic examinations were performed 48 hours after the injections and results were completely normal in all eyes except for those that were injected with 10 mg of ceftazidime, all three of which showed the appearance of cystic change in the macula. The monkeys were killed and the eyes were removed and examined by light and electron microscopy. All eyes were normal by light microscopy except for those injected with 10 mg of ceftazidime, which showed disruption of photoreceptors (primarily outer segments) in the foveas with cystic changes in all three and macular holes in two of three. Electron microscopy showed mild swelling of mitochondria and perinuclear halos around photoreceptor nuclei in both control eyes and in eyes injected with 1 and 2.25 mg. An eye injected with 10 mg showed severe damage to central photoreceptor outer segments consisting of disruption of plasma membranes and accumulation of intracytoplasmic granular material. Inner segments showed mild changes and there was loss of apical microvilli of the retinal pigmented epithelium. The inner retina was normal. These data suggest that high doses of intravitreous ceftazidime show toxicity primarily to photoreceptor cells, but a dose of 2.25 mg is safe as studied in this model and can be used instead of intravitreous aminoglycosides that have a narrow therapeutic window.",0

Electrogram morphology discrimination offers an additional approach to improve discrimination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia (VT). In a prospective, multicenter study, patients received an ICD with a beat-to-beat algorithm for morphological analysis of the intracardiac electrogram (Morphology Discrimination, MD). A nominal programmingfor standard enhancement criteria and morphology discrimination was required at implant. Electrogram storage of tachycardia episodes irrespective of delivery of therapy was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the morphology algorithm alone and in combination with established detection criteria. During a 126 6-month follow-up, 886 episodes of device stored electrograms from 82 of 256patients were evaluated. Atnominal settings, the MD algorithm correctly identified 423 of 551 episodes as VT resulting in sensitivity of 77%. The classification of SVT was met in 239 of 335 episodes resulting in specificity of 71%. In combination with sudden onset, sensitivityincreased to 99.5% at the expense of specificity (48%). In conclusion, SVT-VT discrimination based on morphological analysis alone results in limited sensitivity and specificity. Programming the monitor mode allows individual assessment of the performance of this detection enhancement feature during clinical follow-up without compromising device safety. Only in patients with documented efficacy of morphology discrimination should this feature be subsequently activated.",0

The antisense techniques have been extensively developed from the application of simple long, regular antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules to highly modified versions conferring resistance to nucleases, stability of hybrid formation and other beneficial characteristics, though still preserving the specificity of the original nucleic acids. These new and improved second- and third-generation antisense molecules have shown promising results. The first antisense drug has been approved and more are in clinical trials. However, these antisense drugs are mainly designed for the treatment of different human cancers and other human diseases. Applying antisense gene silencing and exploiting RNA interference (RNAi) are highly developed approaches in many eukaryotic systems. But in bacteria RNAi is absent, and gene silencing by antisense compounds is not nearly as well developed, despite its great potential and the intriguing possibility of applying antisense molecules in the fight against multiresistant bacteria. Recent breakthrough and current status on the development of antisense gene silencing in bacteria including especially phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ODNs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) will be presented in this review.",0

However, the extent to which these effects persist into offspring in subsequent generations has received less attention. In this experiment, maternal and paternal effects on offspring and grand-offspring were investigated in the biparental burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides , using a split-family design. This allowed the separation of prenatal and postnatal transgenerational effects. Grandparent and parent gender were found to have a cumulative effect on offspring development and may provide a selection pressure on the division of parental investment in biparental species.",1
https://doi.org/10.1097/01.cej.0000186638.35119.88,"Trends in cancer mortality in Switzerland, 1980–2001","Trends in cancer mortality in Switzerland were analysed over the period 1980-2001, on the basis of the World Health Organization database. Appropriately developed correction factors were utilized for the period before 1995, to allow for spurious trends introduced by the change between the 8th and the 10th revisions of the ICD. Steady declines in cancer mortality were observed, particularly from the mid-1980s onwards. Over the last decade, the fall in overall age-standardized (world standard) cancer mortality was 11.1% in men (from 158.1 in 1990-1991 to 140.6/100,000 in 2000-2001) and 7.6% in women (from 91.6 to 84.7/100,000), and the decline was larger in truncated rates from 35 to 64 years (-18.0 and -9.7%). In men, all major tobacco and alcohol neoplasms have declined until the late 1990s but have levelled off over the last few years, reflecting recent trends in alcohol and tobacco consumption. The fall in male lung cancer mortality was 20% over the last decade (from 42.9 to 34.3/100,000). In contrast, lung cancer mortality in women has steadily increased by 38% between 1981 and 1991 and by 47% between 1991 and 2001, to reach 10.7/100,000 at all ages and 18.3 at age 35 to 64, due to increased prevalence of smoking in subsequent generations of Swiss women. Other sites showing substantial declines include stomach and colorectum in both sexes, (cervix) uteri and breast in women. Likewise, prostate cancer showed modest favourable trends after 1995. Steady declines were observed for leukaemias, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer, namely, the neoplasms most influenced by therapeutic improvements, while trends in lymphomas and myeloma showed no clear pattern.",0

A number of fimbrial antigens expressed by strains of Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium have now been described and characterized. However, their functions are still poorly understood, although some evidence indicates they have a role in bacterial survival in the host or external environment.

The role of salmonella fimbriae in future generations of live vaccines either as protective antigens or as the carriers of heterologous antigens is also discussed.",0

https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2012-1195,Gestational Exposure to Bisphenol A Produces Transgenerational Changes in Behaviors and Gene Expression,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a plasticizer and an endocrine-disrupting chemical. It is present in a variety of products used daily including food containers, paper, and dental sealants and is now widely detected in human urine and blood. Exposure to BPA during development may affect brain organization and behavior, perhaps as a consequence of its actions as a steroid hormone agonist/antagonist and/or an epigenetic modifier. Here we show that BPA produces transgenerational alterations in genes and behavior. Female mice received phytoestrogen-free chow with or without BPA before mating and throughout gestation. Plasma levels of BPA in supplemented dams were in a range similar to those measured in humans. Juveniles in the first generation exposed to BPA in utero displayed fewer social interactions as compared with control mice, whereas in later generations (F2 and F4), the effect of BPA was to increase these social interactions. Brains from embryos (embryonic d 18.5) exposed to BPA had lower gene transcript levels for several estrogen receptors, oxytocin, and vasopressin as compared with controls; decreased vasopressin mRNA persisted into the F4 generation, at which time oxytocin was also reduced but only in males. Thus, exposure to a low dose of BPA, only during gestation, has immediate and long-lasting, transgenerational effects on mRNA in brain and social behaviors. Heritable effects of an endocrine-disrupting chemical have implications for complex neurological diseases and highlight the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex disease.",1

If so, what was the etiology?","The ""Dictator Perpetuus"" of the Roman Empire, the great Julius Caesar, was not the one for whom the well-known cesarean operation was named; instead, this term is derived from a Latin word meaning ""to cut."" Caesar likely had epilepsy on the basis of four attacks that were probably complex partial seizures: (1) while listening to an oration by Cicero, (2) in the Senate while being offered the Emperor's Crown, and in military campaigns, (3) near Thapsus (North Africa) and (4) Corduba (Spain). Also, it is possible that he had absence attacks as a child and as a teenager. His son, Caesarion, by Queen Cleopatra, likely had seizures as a child, but the evidence is only suggestive. His great-great-great grandnephews Caligula and Britannicus also had seizures. The etiology of these seizures in this Julio-Claudian family was most likely through inheritance, with the possibility of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in his great grandfather and also his father. Our best evidence comes from the ancient sources of Suetonius, Plutarch, Pliny, and Appianus.",0
,[Molecular genetics diagnosis of Steinert's myotonic dystrophy].,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common neuromuscular disease with adult onset (incidence 1 in 8000). The biochemical basis of this autosomal dominantly inherited disease is still unknown. The most striking features are myotonia and progressive muscular wasting. There is high variability of disease severity in patients from different families, but also within the same family. For practical reasons three subtypes can be defined: The classical adult onset form of the disease, a mild form with late onset and/or very moderate symptoms, eg. cataracts only, and the most severe congenital form which is transmitted by affected females. Furthermore, the progression of DM in affected families may exhibit an increase in the severity of the disease in successive generations. This observation is called anticipation. Very recently the DM gene has been cloned and an unstable DNA sequence specific for the disease has been characterized. Detection of an enlarged DNA fragment due to the expansion of a trinucleotide (CTG) repeat within the DM gene can be used for direct DNA diagnosis in affected individuals and persons at risk. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between the length of fragment expansion and the degree of disease severity in gene carriers. We report here our preliminary results of the investigation of over 70 patients and demonstrate the clinical usefulness of this new method by the findings in three families.",0

Discussions explored participant preferences and experiences with family members facing the end of life.Twelve first-generation and 11 second-generation self-identified Asian Indians living in the mid-Atlantic region.Content analysis of focus group transcripts.First-generation participants ranged in age from 41 to 76 years and were evenly split by gender. Second-generation participants ranged in age from 23 to 36 years and included seven women and four men. All participants were highly educated, and two thirds were either studying or working in a health care field. All but two subjects were Hindu. Several themes emerged that highlighted cultural differences and challenges for this population in the context of end-of-life care: attitudes toward death and suffering; family duty; and preferences for information disclosure and decision making. Participants described cultural challenges due to the evolution of traditional roles, lack of explicit discussion between patients and family members about preferences and care expectations, and a tension between wanting to meet traditional expectations and the challenges in doing so given US social realities.Traditional cultural values, such as duty to family, greatly influenced end-of-life care preferences and retained importance across generations. Clinicians caring for Asian Indian patients at the end of life may be better able to assess care preferences after exploring the complex interplay between traditional expectations and specific social realities for each patient. Particular attention should be given to attitudes toward death and suffering, family duty, and preferences for information disclosure and decision making.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01644.x,Phylogenetic limiting similarity and competitive exclusion,"One of the oldest ecological hypotheses, proposed by Darwin, suggests that the struggle for existence is stronger between more closely related species. Despite its long history, the validity of this phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis has rarely been examined. Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a significant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species. Our results support phylogenetic relatedness as a useful predictor of the outcomes of competitive interactions in ecological communities.",0
,Evaluation of an automated hematology system (Technicon H-1).,"We evaluated the Technicon H-1 hematology system, a new third-generation blood cell analyzer that performs a complete blood cell count, including red blood cell (RBC) morphometric studies and a full white blood cell differential count. Linearity and precision were acceptable over the entire clinical range. We compared the H-1 with the Technicon H-6000 and the Coulter S Plus IV. Close correlation was observed for all equivalent parameters except the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), the mean platelet volume, and the basophil count. Poor correlation for the MCHC reflects the novel methodology of the H-1 for measuring RBC size and, independently, RBC hemoglobin content. The H-1 MCHC correlates with hypochromia as assessed morphologically, while the MCHC of the H-6000 or S Plus IV does not. Further technological innovations include measurement of the mean neutrophil peroxidase content and nuclear lobularity.",0

Seven outpatient psychiatric services enrolled a consecutive case series of patients who were being treated, or had started treatment, with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Information on sociodemographic and clinical variables, current psychotropic drug use, side-effects and past use of typical drugs was collected. In addition, patient symptoms and functional status were evaluated by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Patients receiving off-label prescribing of second-generation antipsychotics were identified. A total of 209 patients were collected. In comparison with patients receiving other second-generation antipsychotics, living in residential facilities, unemployment, long psychiatric histories, and problems with activities of daily living and living conditions were more common in clozapine-treated patients. Nearly 80 % of patients receiving clozapine had schizophrenia compared to less than 50 % of those receiving other second-generation antipsychotics. Overall, 109 patients (52 %) received off-label prescriptions of second-generation antipsychotic drugs. This survey indicates that clozapine was mostly reserved for severe cases and poor responders; the high rate of off-label prescriptions highlights the gap existing between recommendations derived from randomised clinical trials and the current use of drugs.",0
,Structure and biological activity of botulinum neurotoxin.,"Botulinum neurotoxin appears to undergo structural alterations after synthesis and also before it inhibits neurotransmitter release. Discussions and conjectures are presented in this context: 1. At what sites on the 150 kDa neurotoxin does posttranslational proteolytic processing occur? 2. Does neurotransmitter inhibition depend on separation of a segment of the neurotoxin from the rest of the molecule? 3. At what step in the intoxication pathway does activation of neurotoxin (enhanced lethality following limited proteolysis) manifest? 4. Can the receptor binding parameters (based on bovine brain synaptosome and lipid membrane), channel forming property (lipid bilayer membrane) and intracellular inhibitory activity (based on permeabilized chromaffin and PC 12 cells) provide clues to differences in the lethal potency between the neurotoxin serotypes? In addition, the following issues are considered: 5. The spontaneous fragmentation of isolated 50 kDa light chain, after its separation from 100 kDa heavy chain, 6. Effect of specific chemical modification of Arg, His, Lys, Trp, Tyr and Asp/Glu residues of types A, B and E neurotoxins on lethality and antigenicity, and 7.

Eight subjects (age range 20–56 years; 5 females and 3 males) belonging to four generations were studied. Onset of disturbances (distal weakness at lower limbs) ranged from 20 to 28 years. CK levels were increased to five times. Only in an early stage oedema of involved muscles has been demonstrated by muscle MR. Quadriceps femoris was characteristically spared; in the last phases a mild involvement of the vasti became evident with persistent sparing of the rectus femori. Rimmed vacuoles and hyperphosphorylated tau filaments were evident at muscle biopsy. Linkage analysis excluded the association of the disease to chromosome loci 14q11, 17p13.1, 2p13, 19p13. The study suggests that quadriceps sparing is a characteristic feature also of AD-IBM.

Nevertheless, we still seem to be lacking Parfit's 'Theory X', a general theory of beneficence whose appropriateness extends to future generations. Starting from the Golden Rule (TGR), R.M. Hare purportedly derived counterintuitive duties to potential people and 'the potentiality principle'. However, I argue that Hare's derivation involves a hidden and unjustifiable extension from TGR, and show how the most plausible form of TGR is compatible with multiple contradictory principles for the treatment of future persons. I appeal to our own preferences to argue that one extension of TGR follows the spirit of TGR, while the other is deeply implausible. Using the plausible extension, I derive a Contingent Interests Principle (CIP) that offers much promise as Parfit's elusive Theory X. In contrast to Hare's interpretation of TGR, this application provides solid justification for rejecting the potentiality principle.",0
,Low prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals from Slovenia and Croatia.,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the population of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals from Slovenia and Croatia was determined. One hundred and sixty-six out of a total of 188 Slovenian HIV-1-infected individuals and 120 subjects who were randomly chosen out of a total 342 Croatian HIV-1 antibodies-positive individuals were tested for HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibodies was carried out by a third generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and the positive samples were additionally tested by a third generation immuno-blot assay. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA was determined in all serum samples by a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four (14.5%) out of 166 Slovenian and 18 (15.0%) out of 120 Croatian HIV-1-infected individuals were HCV antibodies-positive. Nineteen out of 24 (79.2%) Slovenian and 13 out of 18 (72.2%) Croatian anti-HCV positive individuals were also viremic. HCV RNA was not detected in any of 244 HCV antibodies-negative/HIV-1-infected individual from both countries. A significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between blood (77.8% in Slovenia and 66.7% in Croatia) and sexual exposure risk groups (1.6% in Slovenia and 6.6% in Croatia) was found in both countries. In a study carried out on the highest proportion of entire population of HIV-1-infected individuals from a certain country or geographic region, Slovenia and Croatia were identified as countries with the second and third lowest prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-1/HIV-2 infected individuals worldwide.",0

Before infusion, the plasma 22:6 n-3 level was 0.2 nmol ml(-1) in 18:3 n-3-deficient compared with 10.6 nmol ml(-1) in control rats. Brain unesterified 22:6 n-3 was not detectable, whereas docosahexaenoyl-CoA content was reduced by 95%, and 22:6 n-3 content in different phospholipid classes was reduced by 83-88% in deficient rats. Neither plasma or brain arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) level was significantly changed with diet. Docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n-6) reciprocally replaced 22:6 n-3 in brain phospholipids. Calculations using operational equations from our model indicated that 22:6 n-3 incorporation from plasma into brain was reduced 40-fold by 18:3 n-3 deficiency. Recycling of 22:6 n-3 due to deacylation-reacylation within phospholipids was reduced by 30-70% with the deficient diet, but animals nevertheless continued to produce 22:6 n-3 and docosahexaenoyl-CoA for brain function. We propose that functional brain effects of n-3 deficiency reflect altered ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids.",1

The number of isolates from each hospital ranged from 3 to 82. The genetic relationship between isolates was established by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). bla(ESBL) types and other antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by PCR and sequencing. Plasmids were classified according to their incompatibility group by a PCR-based replicon-typing scheme.All 162 isolates carried the bla(CTX-15) gene. Fifty-eight isolates (35.8%) caused clinical infections and 104 (64.2%) were colonizers. Sixty-nine (42.6%) isolates were collected from newborns and 93 (57.4%) from adults. Using PGFE, the 162 isolates were grouped into seven clusters that were further identified as members of the MLST types 1, 11, 14, 17, 20, 35 and 36. Two hospitals each had two different clones and the remaining three hospitals had a single CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae clone. All clones carried different antibiotic resistance genes, including bla(OXA-1), aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrS1 and qnrB. In four of the seven (57.1%) clones the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was transferred by conjugation; in all cases plasmids of the incompatibility group IncF were identified by PCR.This study shows that multiresistant K. pneumoniae producing CTX-M-15 of MLST types 1, 11, 14, 17, 20, 35 and 36 are spreading as pathogens and colonizers among newborns and adult patients in Spain.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s101470200038,The role of aromatase inactivators in the treatment of breast cancer,"Third-generation aromatase inhibitors and inactivators have earned their place in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The third-generation aromatase inactivator exemestane was found to be superior to megestrol acetate as second-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women, with respect to time to progression as well as overall survival, and the results from an ongoing study comparing exemestane with tamoxifen in first-line treatment are promising. The finding that exemestane may also work in patients previously exposed to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors reveals lack of complete cross-resistance between the compounds. Currently, exemestane given as monotherapy, or in sequence with tamoxifen (2-3 + 3-2 years of tamoxifen-exemestane or 5 years of tamoxifen followed by 2 years of exemestane) is being compared with tamoxifen 5 years monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In addition, we are currently addressing the toxicity of exemestane in a placebo-controlled trial in low-risk breast-cancer patients. The results from these studies will outline the potential role of exemestane in adjuvant treatment and, potentially, for breast-cancer prevention in postmenopausal women.",0

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF) was used to monitor the non-biological specimens utilizing a customized panel of 65+ compounds comprised of synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic stimulants and other related drugs. Over the past year, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency has controlled five synthetic cannabinoid compounds (JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-200, CP-47,497 and CP-47,497-C8) and three synthetic stimulant compounds (3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone, mephedrone and methylone) that were previously reported to be detected in these legal high products. Through our analyses of first and second generation products, it was shown that many of these banned substances are no longer used and have been replaced by other derivatives that are federally legal. Since enactment of the federal bans on synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic stimulants, 4.9% of the products analyzed at our facility contained at least one controlled substance. The remaining 95.1% of products contained only uncontrolled drugs. We demonstrate the UPLC-TOF methodology to be a powerful tool in the qualitative identification of these designer drugs, thus enabling a laboratory to keep current with the drugs that are being sold as these designer products.",0

DATA SOURCES: Published articles were identified from MEDLINE (from 1966 to December 2000) and Current Contents (all sections) searches. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Dose-ranging and pivotal studies were included for analysis in the clinical trials section. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tenecteplase is a third-generation thrombolytic indicated for the reduction of mortality associated with AMI. Tenecteplase has a longer half-life that allows for single-dose, intravenous bolus administration. Data from clinical trials support that tenecteplase is similar to alteplase in reducing 30-day mortality rates in patients who have had an AMI. In the ASSENT-2 (Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic) trial, patients treated with tenecteplase required fewer blood transfusions and experienced fewer episodes of noncerebral bleeding compared with those treated with alteplase. CONCLUSIONS: Tenecteplase is an effective thrombolytic agent for the treatment of AMI. It can be given as a single weight-based dose; however, it appears to offer no significant advantage over other agents in terms of its efficacy or rate of intracranial hemorrhage.",0
,Etiological factors of community acquired urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients,"INTRODUCTION Etiological factors of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI) are specific for age, gender, season, complication of UTI and type of UTI. Their prevalence and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents shows geographic and time variability. PURPOSE To evaluate etiological characteristics of acute community-acquired UTI in hospitalised patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective-prospective study included 200 adult patients with community-acquired UTI who were, in view of the serious clinical picture and unsuccessful ambulatory treatment, hospitalised in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Tuzla, for a period of two years (2006 and 2007). The data concerning the age, gender, season, complication of UTI and type of UTI were collected from the patient's records. Urine analysis was done following standard microbiological methods, and the antibiogram was done following standard disc-diffusion method on the Mueller-Hinton agar. WORK RESULTS The dominant etiological factors of UTI were: E. coli (73.5%), Klebsiella spp. (8.5%), Proteus mirabilis (5.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and Enterococcus faecalis (3%). The predominant etiological factor of this UTI was E. coli (P 0.05). All etiological factors are significantly more frequent during warmer periods of the year (P < 0.05). E. coli is a significantly more frequent etiological factor in complicated and non-complicated pyelonephrytis and cystourethritis (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference of frequency between etiological factors of prostatitis (P = 0.7163). By analyzing the susceptibility for antimicrobials, we found that E. coli has good susceptibility for Cephalosporins of the third generation, for Gentamycin, Nitrofurantoin, Norfloxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Pipemidin acid (susceptibility higher than 88.7%), Klebsiella spp. for Imipenem and Meropenem (susceptibility 100%), Proteus mirabilis for Imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for Amikacin (susceptibility 81.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for Imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and for Meropenem (susceptibility 87.5%) and Enterococcus faecalis for Vancomycin (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Doxicyclin and Nitrofurantoin (susceptibility 83.4%). CONCLUSION Etiological characteristics of UTI are specific for different regions. Evaluation of these characteristics in our region is the basis for empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI, which is necessary for a timely and successful treatment of UTI.",0

Two main themes emerged from the interviews. Firstly, a clear majority of the young adults had positive experiences of family life during their upbringing, as expressed especially through their memories of their grandparents. Secondly, the study participants all described experiences of being bullied and harassed outside the family context. The results obtained in this study highlight the importance of the parents, the family, and informal networks in the upbringing of these children. The study also considers the consequences that the study participants’ negative experiences of peer contacts and their sense of exclusion might have for their prospects in later life.",0

This compound selectively binds to both of the estrogen receptors with a high affinity and a median inhibitory concentration that is similar to that seen with estradiol and > or = 10-fold higher than those reported for other SERMs (raloxifene and tamoxifen). Lasofoxifene has a remarkably improved oral bioavailability with respect to other SERMs due to increased resistance to intestinal wall glucuronidation. In both preclinical and short-term studies, the compound showed a favourable safety profile and demonstrated a proven efficacy in preventing bone loss and lowering cholesterol levels. Dose modelling from Phase II studies allowed the selection of lasofoxifene 0.25 mg/day as the lowest fully effective dose.",0
,"Phase I study of ethylenediamine platinum(II) malonate (NSC 146 068), a second generation platinum analogue.","Ethylenediamine platinum(II) malonate [JM-40 (NSC 146 068)] has been selected for clinical studies because of its favorable preclinical toxicity profile as a ""second generation"" platinum analogue. When compared to cisplatin, JM-40 was less emetic in the ferret and less nephrotoxic in the dog, while its antitumor activity approached that of cisplatin. Twenty-nine patients received 86 courses of JM-40 as a single dose every 3-4 wk. After 13 dose escalation steps the maximum tolerable dose was reached at 1200 mg/m2. The dose limiting toxicities were nausea, vomiting, and nephrotoxicity. The renal damage seemed reversible up to a dose level of 1000 mg/m2 and consisted of a glomerular and tubular dysfunction. JM-40 did not cause any other dose related side effect or myelo-suppression. Pharmacokinetic studies at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 revealed mean terminal half-lives of 5.0 and 1.9 days for platinum in plasma and plasma ultrafiltrate, respectively. The mean cumulative excretion of platinum in urine accounted for 57% of the dose up to day 5. Two partial responses were observed in a patient with a large cell carcinoma of the lung and in one with a carcinoma of the lacrimal gland. Limited evaluation of JM-40 in phase II studies is warranted. The recommended dose is 1000 mg/m2 every 4 wk and 800 mg/m2 for patients pretreated with platinum analogues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1155/2010/654348,Musculoskeletal Adverse Events Associated with Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitors,"Musculoskeletal symptoms including arthralgia and myalgia occur frequently in aging women, particularly during the transition to menopause, when plasma estrogens precipitously decline. In postmenopausal women (PMW) with breast cancer, third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as adjuvant hormonal therapy have proven to be more effective, and to have a more predictable side effect profile, than tamoxifen. However, AIs further reduce plasma estrogens in PMW, exacerbating musculoskeletal symptoms. Clinical trial data have shown significantly higher incidences of arthralgia and myalgia with AIs compared with women on tamoxifen or placebo. Symptoms may be severe enough to significantly affect quality of life; musculoskeletal symptoms are a frequent reason for discontinuing therapy. In many cases, symptoms can be effectively managed with oral analgesics or other strategies. Early recognition and effective management of musculoskeletal symptoms can help maximize treatment compliance, enabling patients to derive optimal benefit from therapy in terms of preventing recurrence.",0

It is unclear how the different cell layers attain and retain their identities. Here, we show that WRKY transcription factors are in part responsible for the parenchymatous nature of the pith cells in dicotyledonous plants. We isolated mutants of Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana with secondary cell wall thickening in pith cells associated with ectopic deposition of lignin, xylan, and cellulose, leading to an ∼50% increase in biomass density in stem tissue of the Arabidopsis mutants. The mutations are caused by disruption of stem-expressed WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes, which consequently up-regulate downstream genes encoding the N AM, A TAF1/2, and C UC2 (NAC) and CCCH type (C3H) zinc finger TFs that activate secondary wall synthesis. Direct binding of WRKY to the NAC gene promoter and repression of three downstream TFs were confirmed by in vitro assays and in planta transgenic experiments. Secondary wall-bearing cells form lignocellulosic biomass that is the source for second generation biofuel production. The discovery of negative regulators of secondary wall formation in pith opens up the possibility of significantly increasing the mass of fermentable cell wall components in bioenergy crops.",0
https://doi.org/10.1139/g95-034,Gene action for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew in wheat,"Gene action for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew was studied using generation mean analyses of parents and of F 1 , F 2 , and backcross populations derived from a diallel cross of one susceptible and three adult-plant resistant wheat cultivars. Joint scaling tests showed that an additive–dominance model was sufficient to explain the variability in the expression of adult-plant resistance in one cross, while digenic epistasis was involved in the other five crosses. Additive gene effects were predominant; however, dominance was significant in four crosses, additive × additive interaction was significant in three crosses, additive × dominance interaction was significant in three crosses, and dominance × dominance interaction was significant in one cross. Therefore, selection for adult-plant resistance would likely be most effective in advanced generations derived from crosses among the adult-plant resistant cultivars Redcoat, Houser, and Massey.Key words: gene action, adult-plant resistance, Blumeria, Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici, Triticum aestivum.",0

A focussed quantitative trait loci analysis using four microsatellite markers within the telomeric region of porcine chromosome 2p was conducted in a large resource population comprising 2741 F2 offspring. The analysis of two subsets of animals that were alternatively homozygous for the in3G3072A mutation provides evidence for additional genetic variation significantly contributing to the overall quantitative trait nucleotide variance within our population.,0

A prospective study of 192 transfusion recipients was performed to compare the incidence of NANB PTH after the introduction of the second-generation anti-HCV test with the incidence before its introduction. We used a polymerase chain reaction to detect HCV-RNA and HBV-DNA in the sera of patients with NANB PTH. The incidence of acute post-transfusion hepatitis C was 11% (8 of 71) before the screening for anti-HCV as compared with 2.5% (3 of 121) after the screening (p < 0.05). Viremia was detected within the first five weeks of infection in 10 patients with acute post-transfusion hepatitis C. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of non-A, non-B, non-C (NANBNC) PTH before screening (3 of 71, 4.2%) compared with after screening (3 of 121, 2.5%). Usually, NANBNC PTH was not clinically important. Anti-HCV screening of blood donors significantly reduces the incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis C, but not the incidence of NANBNC PTH.",0
https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.v84551,Angiotensin II inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase in tubular MCT cells by a posttranscriptional mechanism.,"Expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and generation of nitric oxide (NO) have been recently described, in addition to mesangial and medullary thick ascending limb cells, in proximal tubular cells, including MCT, a mouse proximal tubular epithelium cell line. Because vasoconstrictors may interfere with the induction of iNOS and the subsequent generation of NO, in the study presented here, whether exogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) influences bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/gamma-interferon (gamma-IF)-stimulated NO synthesis and iNOS protein and mRNA expression in MCT cells was tested. LPS/gamma-IF readily stimulated nitrite synthesis in MCT cells, as one measured parameter of NO synthesis. Coincubation of cells with 10(-9)-10(-6) M ANG II attenuated this LPS/gamma-IF-stimulated induction of nitrite. This effect was reversed by the AT1-receptor blocker losartan, but not by an AT2-receptor antagonist, indicating signal transduction through AT1-receptors. Western blot analysis applying a specific monoclonal antibody generated against mouse iNOS revealed that 10(-8)-10(-6) M ANG II significantly reduced LPS/gamma-IF-induced iNOS protein expression. However, ANG II had no effect on LPS/gamma-IF-induced iNOS mRNA as assessed by Northern blots. Moreover, transient transfection studies using a chimeric gene construct, in which iNOS regulatory elements are linked to the CAT reporter gene, showed no effect of ANG II on the LPS/gamma-IF-stimulated transcriptional activity. The study presented here demonstrates that ANG II influences LPS/gamma-IF-stimulated NO generation in MCT cells, most likely at a posttranscriptional level, by influencing iNOS protein expression. Whether proximal tubular cells in vivo express iNOS remains to be established, but this study suggests a mechanism for how iNOS activity is influenced by ANG II in cultured proximal tubular cells.",0

,Epidermodysplasia verruciformis: response to therapy with dialyzable leukocyte extract (transfer factor) derived from household contacts.,"Dialyzable leukocyte extracts (DLE) have been used to treat a variety of antigen selective, and broad spectrum immunodeficiency diseases with sometimes encouraging results. We describe here the clinical and laboratory responses to DLE therapy of 2 patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a chronic cutaneous infection with a variety of human papilloma viruses. One patient with longstanding (30 yr) disease and no improvement to previous therapy showed gradual yet definite resolution of extensive verrucae planae, plaque, tinea-versicolor-like, and tumor lesions scattered over his entire integument. Cessation of DLE therapy for a short time resulted in recurrence of partially regressed lesions and also in the development of new tumors in this patient. The second patient, a grandson of the first patient, with minimal disease showed no progression of the disease during DLE prophylaxis. A third subject (brother of patient number 2) received no DLE and served as a control. All 3 subjects demonstrated severely depressed levels of suppressor T cells, a defect in cell-mediated immunity that has not been hitherto reported in patients with EV. Finally, evidence is presented for a possible X-linked recessive mode of inheritance for susceptibility to EV.",0

Antipsychotic agents are frequently used to treat pathologic behaviors in traumatic brain injury patients, but the influence of prolonged administration of such drugs on cognition after injury is unknown. The effects of two antipsychotic drugs on cognitive recovery after traumatic brain injury were assessed using the fluid percussion model in rats.The typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, and the third-generation antipsychotic, olanzapine, were administered via intraperitoneal injection beginning 24 hr after injury and continuing daily for the duration of the study. Morris water maze performance was assessed on days 11-15 postinjury.Haloperidol, an antagonist acting on D2-like dopamine receptors, exacerbated the cognitive deficits induced by injury, as injured rats treated with 0.30 mg/kg haloperidol performed worse in the Morris water maze than injured rats treated with vehicle.Our results demonstrate the importance of the D2 receptor in cognitive recovery after traumatic brain injury. Also, the data illustrate that some classes of antipsychotic drugs may influence cognitive recovery, and further research is needed to determine the optimal pharmacologic treatment of aggression, agitation, and other pathologic behaviors in patients with traumatic brain injury.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07111.x,Damped oscillations in the adaptive response of the iron homeostasis network ofE. coli,"Living organisms often have to adapt to sudden environmental changes and reach homeostasis. To achieve adaptation, cells deploy motifs such as feedback in their genetic networks, endowing the cellular response with desirable properties. We studied the iron homeostasis network of E. coli, which employs feedback loops to regulate iron usage and uptake, while maintaining intracellular iron at non-toxic levels. Using fluorescence reporters for iron-dependent promoters in bulk and microfluidics-based, single-cell experiments, we show that E. coli cells exhibit damped oscillations in gene expression, following sudden reductions in external iron levels. The oscillations, lasting for several generations, are independent of position along the cell cycle. Experiments with mutants in network components demonstrate the involvement of iron uptake in the oscillations. Our findings suggest that the response is driven by intracellular iron oscillations large enough to induce nearly full network activation/deactivation. We propose a mathematical model based on a negative feedback loop closed by rapid iron uptake, and including iron usage and storage, which captures the main features of the observed behaviour. Taken together, our results shed light on the control of iron metabolism in bacteria and suggest that the oscillations represent a compromise between the requirements of stability and speed of response.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03597,"Simulations of the formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies and quasars","The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.",0

Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of public health insurance relative to private (employment-based or privately purchased) health insurance by generation status, controlling for individual characteristics. The outcome of interest was public health insurance among three health insurance categories: private health insurance, public health insurance, and uninsured. Both first and second generation immigrants were more likely to have public health insurance than were nonimmigrants. However, the difference vanished, when demography, socioeconomic status, health status, employment sector, and English facility were controlled for. The combined effect of lower returns to education and lower employment-based insurance offer rates seems to be the underlying cause of higher prevalence of public health insurance among ethnic minorities.",0

Exclusion of the left atrial appendage may reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The atrial exclusion device, previously developed to perform left atrial appendage exclusion on a beating heart, was modified to accommodate different anatomic patterns of the human left atrial appendage and to ensure uniform pressure and occlusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this second-generation atrial exclusion device during a midterm period in a canine model.Ten mongrel dogs (mean weight 28.9 +/- 4.6 kg) were used in this study. The atrial exclusion device, constructed from two parallel and rigid titanium tubes and two nitinol springs with a knit-braided polyester fabric, was implanted at the base of the left atrial appendage through a left thoracotomy on a beating heart using a specially designed delivery tool. Dogs were evaluated at 30 days (n = 4) and 90 days (n = 6) by epicardial echocardiography, left atrial and coronary angiography, gross pathology, and histologic inspection.Device implantation was performed without complications in all dogs. Complete left atrial appendage exclusion without device migration or hemodynamic instability was confirmed, and there was no damage to the left circumflex artery or pulmonary artery. Macroscopic and microscopic assessments revealed favorable biocompatibility during midterm follow-up.The atrial exclusion device enabled rapid, reliable, and safe exclusion of the left atrial appendage. Clinical application may provide a new therapeutic option for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.",0

Methods The coding region of TNFR1 was sequenced in 2 individuals with TRAPS (the propositus and her grandfather) and in 3 clinically unaffected relatives. Expression of soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1) was investigated in 3 of the family members carrying a C30S mutation in TNFR1, and was compared with the levels of soluble TNFR2 (sTNFR2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The membrane TNFR1 expression was then compared with membrane TNFR2 levels at the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by flow cytometric analysis. The clinical heterogeneity in this French family was investigated by searching polymorphic variants in the TNFα promoter by DNA sequencing. Results Both the disease course and the clinical presentation in the propositus were highly indicative of TRAPS. MRI study of the segmental inflammatory process in the limbs showed abnormal signals in the muscle and subcutaneous tissue without involvement of adjacent joints or fascia. A novel missense mutation, C30S, in the first extracellular N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD1) of TNFR1 was characterized in the propositus, her affected grandfather, and her clinically unaffected father. Expression of membrane TNFR1 at the surface of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as the levels of sTNFR1 in serum when the disease was not active were not modified in the 3 individuals carrying the TNFR1 C30S mutation. In contrast, during attacks, sTNFR1 levels remained abnormally low, as compared with the levels in unrelated patients with active adult-onset systemic Still's disease. The clinical heterogeneity could not be explained by a polymorphic variant in the TNFα promoter. Conclusion TRAPS is a distinct clinical and radiologic disease entity that is responsible for recurrent fever and migratory cellulitis-like processes with localized myositis. We have identified a novel TNFR1 mutation, C30S, that is located in the CRD1 domain in a French family affected by the disease. This mutation seems to affect the level of sTNFR1, which did not increase in the propositus during inflammatory attacks.",0
https://doi.org/10.1586/erc.12.164,Clinical safety and efficacy of a next-generation stent-graft device for thoracic endovascular aortic repair,"Thoracic endovascular aortic repair has significantly improved the treatment of patients with acute and chronic diseases of the descending thoracic aorta. Retrograde transarterial implantation of a membrane-covered stent graft aims at excluding the aortic pathology at risk for complications (e.g., aneurysm, dissection) from the circulation to prevent expansion and ultimately rupture. Today, several stent grafts from different manufacturers are approved by the respective authorities and thus commercially available. The Medtronic Talent® stent graft used to be one of the initially available devices and has been broadly used to become the world-wide market leader at its time. In 2005, it has been replaced by the second-generation Medtronic Valiant® device, which features several technical improvements. In this article, we evaluate a recent publication investigating the clinical performance of this second-generation stent graft device, and discuss the results in the view of the current literature and developments.",0

The brood sizes of worms grown without cholesterol were substantially reduced in subsequent generations as compared to the control group with cholesterol: 13, 33, and 39% at the first, the second, and the third generation, respectively. The growth rate was also reduced by 20%-26%. Worms became adults after 120-130 hr incubation at 20 degrees C. Embryonic lethality was detected in the range of 1.6%-2.9% as compared to 0.8% of the control group. The percent development from an embryo to an adult was lowered by an average of 10%. Further analyses of germ line development to understand the reduction of brood size revealed that both germ line proliferation and differentiation were affected, and the most striking effect was seen in oogenesis. Defective oogenesis resulted in endomitotic oocytes (Emo, 22% at F1, 26% at F2, and 30% at F3). Thus, cholesterol appears to be required for all developmental stages of C. elegans.",1
,Grandmothers' influence on mother and child health.,"This study is based on interviews with grandmothers during July-September 1992-93 in Sudan. The study shows that grandmothers play a significant role in health education and child care within families in the Sudan. Grandmothers, who are not aware of the changes in knowledge, also promote harmful traditions. The authors recommend that health education be directed to elderly women and grandmothers in order to change beliefs and practices that continue to be harmful to children and mothers. Grandmothers were found to give sound advice on child birth, such as movement during labor, breast feeding immediately after birth, and birth intervals of 2-4 years. Grandmothers also gave sound advice on good nutritional practices during pregnancy and use of fermented cereals as weaning foods. Grandmothers recommended use of fenugreek for lactating mothers and use of mint and haharaib for stomach upsets, remedies that are beneficial. Babul is useful after an episiotomy for its antibacterial effects. Harmful advice includes recircumcision after delivery, short birth intervals, and avoidance of contraception. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a major practice that exposes girls and mothers to a greater risk of mortality during childbirth and pregnancy. The sample of grandmothers agreed on the importance of sex education for a girl before marriage. Unfortunately, 57% of grandmothers recommended 14 years as a suitable age for marriage. Grandmothers generally believed wrongly that riding bicycles, drinking coffee, and wearing trousers by girls would increase their sexual desires. Grandmothers explained menstruation to granddaughters and offered home-made remedies for cramps. 45% believed that there were no disadvantages to FGM and recommended FGM at ages 2-5 years. Most viewed fevers as a danger that required a doctor's care. Advice varied among grandmothers according to socioeconomic class.",1

The availability of these compounds has resulted in accidental or intentional human ingestions, which cause severe bleeding. The methods for diagnosis and treatment of patients using superwarfarins are different from those for patients taking the regular warfarins. We report a case of intentional superwarfarin ingestion that caused petechiae and hematuria. Although the patient denied taking anticoagulant, the persistence of vitamin K-dependent factor deficiency led us to investigate the serum for anticoagulant rodenticides. We found high levels of brodifacoum, a superwarfarin compound. This case emphasizes the need for suspicion of superwarfarin poisoning in patients who show unexplained bleeding due to deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors and resistance to treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2788.2011.01468.x,The overweight: obesity and plasma lipids in adults with intellectual disability and mental illness,"Previous studies in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) have reported a higher prevalence of obesity than in the general population, and a trend to an increase in the prevalence of excess weight. However, little information is available on body weight status and lipids levels of adults with ID and co-existing mental illness. The aim of this study was to address this information gap, by conducting a stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict BMI, thereby allowing the investigation of (semi-)partial correlations, which assess the extent to which a particular predictor variable is associated with BMI over and above the other predictors.A study of the patients with ID and psychiatric illness registered in the service. Collected data included body mass index (BMI), age, gender, the presence of additional physical conditions, residential status, mental illness and use the psychotropic medication. We analysed the lipid profile including serum cholesterol together with low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides and the serum cholesterol/HDL ratio. Data for these variables were entered into a stepwise multiple linear regression to predict BMI.28% of the participants were overweight and 41% obese. Most of the obese patients were men with mild ID (P = 0.039). Level of ID (P = 0.003), gender (P = 0.001) and serum triglycerides (P = 0.026) had significant predictive value in the regression model. There were no significant differences in either the mean serum cholesterol levels or the mean triglyceride levels between those taking and those not taking first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics or anti-epileptic medication.The rate of obesity in our sample was higher than in previous studies. The most predictive combination of predictors to predict BMI was ID level, gender and serum triglyceride levels. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels did not appear to be unduly affected by first- or second-generation antipsychotic medication or by antiepileptic medication.",0
,Embryopathic action of N-nitrosomethylurea in the pregnant mouse manifest for three generations.,"A high incidence of tumour bearing animals (T.B.A.) occurred in the 3 generations of mice descended from dams exposed to N.M.U. on the 18th day of gestation (20 mg/Kg/ip). In the first generation, T.B.A.s (p less than 0.001 binomial analysis) were detected early and were due largely to reticuloses in males and females. In the second generation, T.B.A.s were again in increased number and involved young mice; females were particularly affected by reticuloses, 9 had these neoplasms compared with 2 in the controls. In the 3rd generation, the number of tumour bearing females was double that in the concurrent controls. Offspring from treated dams had a significantly increased incidence of reticuloses, in the first generation this amounted to p less than 0.05 (binomial analysis) and in the second to (p less than 0.01). A high incidence of mortality persisted for 3 generations. In the first, 18 per cent died by 80 weeks compared with 7 per cent of the controls; this difference was significant (p less than 0.05). In the second generation, 15 per cent died compared with 10 per cent of the controls. Sixteen per cent of the third generation also died, white the control incidence remained at 10 per cent.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/000456329503200308,Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Measurement Using a Third Generation Immunometric Assay,"After an initial evaluation of the standard procedure for performance of a third generation TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) assay (Amerlite TSH-30) modifications were made to standardize the timing of measurement of light emission following signal reagent addition. By adopting this optimized procedure, a significant improvement in assay sensitivity was achieved when compared to a second generation TSH assay (DAKO). Using the optimized assay the sensitivity was 0·003 mU/L (20 replicates of zero) or 0·009 mU/L [22% CV (coefficient of variation) from the precision profile]. Recovery of added TSH and parallelism of the assay were good. A significant negative bias was detected for the Amerlite TSH-30 assay when compared to the DAKO assay (log y = 0·92 log x − 0·33, n = 210). Excellent discrimination was achieved between euthyroid, hypothyroid and thyrotoxic subjects. A high percentage of thyrotoxic patients had undetectable TSH and the spread of values between thyrotoxic and euthyroid was greater with the third generation assay. In patients receiving thyroxine therapy a higher percentage had detectable TSH values. The optimized Amerlite TSH 30 assay offers improved assay performance when compared to a second generation assay.",0

In this study, we confirmed that this was the case because spermatids by themselves could not induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of oocytes, the pivotal signal in oocyte activation. Repetitive rises in [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ oscillations), lasting for at least 3 h as observed at fertilization, were produced by a single injection of adenophostin B isolated from fungal products, a novel nonmetabolizable agonist of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3r), which mediates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ oscillations were blocked by an antibody against the type 1 InsP3r. About 95% of oocytes were activated by adenophostin (0.3-0.4 microM in the oocyte). Simultaneous injection of a round spermatid and adenophostin resulted in 55% fertilization success in association with male and female pronucleus formation and development to two-cell embryos. Furthermore, 25% of two-cell embryos that were transplanted to foster mothers developed to normal offspring. All infants grew into adults that reproduced healthy second generations. Adenophostin will be useful for parthenogenetic oocyte activation in the biotechnology of animal reproduction. Injection combined with precursor spermatozoa may be applicable to assisted conception therapy for patients with defective spermatogenesis.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-5794-0_19,Rice transformation: bombardment,"Bombardment-based methodology is responsible for the effective genetic manipulation of major cereals including rice. Many groups reported significant advances on various aspects of rice molecular biology and genetic engineering using procedures based on bombardment technology. Molecular and genetic characterization of large numbers of these plants (more than 500 independent transgenic plants) provided information on structure, expression and stability of integrated DNA through multiple generations. Such evaluations were carried out in the greenhouse and in the field. Stability of expression was found to be dependent on the nature of the promoter and the transgene, and in specific cases on gene copy number. Direct DNA transfer utilizing particle bombardment for the delivery of foreign DNA into rice tissue results in the recovery of large numbers of independently derived transgenic plants in a variety-independent fashion. Gene copy number, level and stability of expression of transgenes can be compared to other DNA delivery methods, direct or indirect, including Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. In this paper, the technology is summarized and discussed in terms of present and future applications, including field trials and potential commercialization of transgenic rice expressing a number of genes of agronomic interest such as pest and herbicide resistance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(90)90322-5,Empiric therapy of severe infections in adults,"The third-generation cephalosporins are useful for empiric therapy of most of the severe infections in adults as a result of their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity (particularly against clinically important gram-negative bacteria), good tissue penetration, and lack of serious adverse effects. This review examines their use in respiratory tract infections, bacterial meningitis, skin-structure infections, and urinary tract infections in adult patients. Penicillin G remains the optimal therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, since Streptococcus pneumoniae still accounts for the majority of cases. However, for empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, therapy must ensure coverage both of aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy in the treatment of urinary tract infections depends on the pattern of resistance in the patient's environment. At present, the treatment of bacterial meningitis in otherwise healthy adults does not constitute a major problem provided that penicillin resistance among pneumococci and meningococci (responsible for at least 80 percent of cases) does not become a clinical problem. However, in meningitis in which gram-negative bacilli are suspected and where specific problems include antibiotic resistance among these organisms and the inadequate penetration of many antibiotics into the cerebrospinal fluid, third-generation cephalosporins are the drugs of choice, and they have markedly improved the clinical outcome. Most skin-structure infections are due to S. aureus and are best treated by an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or an older cephalosporin. Nevertheless, the third-generation cephalosporins have proved to be highly effective agents for infections of skin and soft-tissue infections associated with both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in patients at risk from these organisms or in the elderly.",0

https://doi.org/10.3109/10253890.2011.605487,Effects of chronic social stress during lactation on maternal behavior and growth in rats,"Maternal mood disorders such as depression and chronic anxiety can negatively affect the lives of not only mothers, but also of partners, offspring, and future generations. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress is common in postpartum mothers, and one of the strongest predictors of postpartum depression is social conflict. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of chronic social stress (CSS) during lactation on the maternal behavior (which consists of maternal care and aggression toward a novel conspecific) of lactating rats, as well as on the growth of the dams and their offspring. It was hypothesized that chronic daily exposure to a novel male intruder would alter the display of maternal behavior and impair growth in both the dam and offspring during lactation due to the potentially disruptive effects on maternal behavior and/or lactation. The data indicate that CSS during lactation attenuates maternal care and the growth of both dams and pups, and increases self-grooming and maternal aggression toward a novel male intruder. These results support the use of CSS as a relevant model for disorders that impair maternal behavior and attenuate growth of the offspring, such as postpartum depression and anxiety.",0
https://doi.org/10.4158/ep.2.2.118,Rationale for Prevention and Treatment of Glucose-Mediated Macrosomia: A Protocol for Gestational Diabetes,"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><h3>Objective</h3> To formulate a rationale for preventing and treating hyperglycemia during pregnancy and the concomitant risk of macrosomia. <h3>Methods</h3> We reviewed pertinent studies in the literature and personal experience with patients who had gestational diabetes. In addition, dietary and exercise interventions in the management of such patients were assessed. <h3>Results</h3> During pregnancy, sequential hormonal increases occur to provide glucose substrate to the fetus. When a pregnant woman has a limited insulin secretory capacity and cannot produce enough insulin to compensate for the effect of diabetogenic hormones, gestational diabetes occurs (usually during the second trimester). Maternal hyperglycemia reportedly increases fetal secretion of insulin, and fetal hyperinsulinemia may predispose the fetus to macrosomia. Thus, metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes during pregnancy result in long-term effects on the offspring, including insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes, which in turn may contribute to transmission of risk for development of the same problems in subsequent generations. Insulin therapy, dietary measures, and exercise have helped to achieve euglycemia in patients with gestational diabetes. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Universal screening for gestational diabetes is optimally performed at 26 weeks of gestation. Treatment of diagnosed cases, by insulin, diet, and exercise regimens, will decrease the occurrence of glucose-related macrosomia, improve the outcome of the pregnancy, and reduce the risks for obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in future progeny. <b>(Endocr Pract. 1996; 2:118-129)</b>",0

This study was designed to determine whether the rates of consanguinity and family history of cancer among the families of children with lymphoid malignancy are different from those in the general population.The study comprised 117 patients from the whole of the country with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), ranging in age from 2 to 14 years. The consanguinity rate in the study group was compared with the rate in the general population. To study family history of cancer, the authors matched patients with 117 controls. In a telephone interview, each mother was asked to provide data regarding the biologic relationship between her and her husband as well as that between both sets of grandparents; each was also asked whether any family relative had a cancer and, if so, of what type.Among the 69 ALL cases, 80% of families were consanguineous and 20% were nonconsanguineous. Among the 26 NHL and 22 HL cases, each group included 3 consanguineous families, 12% and 14%, respectively. The consanguinity rates for ALL, NHL, and HL were all significantly different from the 50.5% consanguinity rate in the UAE population (all three P values < 0.0001). The family history of cancer was more often positive in ALL patients than in controls (odds ratio, 2.14; confidence interval, 1.01--4.53). Overall and for each lymphoid malignancy, there was no difference in family history of cancer between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous groups of cases.The consanguinity rate in the families of patients with ALL is significantly higher and in those with NHL and HL significantly lower than that in the UAE population. The family history of cancer is more often positive among ALL cases than controls--consanguinity having no effect.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2011_196,Applications of Second Generation Sequencing Technologies in Complex Disorders,"Second generation sequencing (2ndGS) technologies generate unprecedented amounts of sequence data very rapidly and at relatively limited costs, allowing the sequence of a human genome to be completed in a few weeks. The principle is on the basis of generating millions of relatively short reads from amplified single DNA fragments using iterative cycles of nucleotide extensions. However, the data generated on this scale present new challenges in interpretation, data analysis and data management. 2ndGS technologies are becoming widespread and are profoundly impacting biomedical research. Common applications include whole-genome sequencing, target resequencing, characterization of structural and copy number variation, profiling epigenetic modifications, transcriptome sequencing and identification of infectious agents. New methodologies and instruments that will enable to sequence the complete human genome in less than a day at a cost of less than $1,000 are currently in development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1336.004,Seminiferous Cord Formation and Germ-Cell Programming: Epigenetic Transgenerational Actions of Endocrine Disruptors,"The molecular and cellular control of embryonic testis development was investigated through an analysis of the embryonic testis transcriptome to identify potential regulatory factors for male sex determination and testis morphogenesis. One critical factor identified is neurotropin 3 (NT3). At the onset of male sex determination, Sertoli cells initiate differentiation and express NT3 to act as a chemotactic factor for mesonephros cells to migrate and associate with Sertoli-germ cell aggregates to promote cord formation. Promoter analysis suggests that NT3 may be an initial downstream gene to SRY and helps promote testis morphogenesis. Endocrine disruptors were used to potentially interfere with embryonic testis development and further investigate this biological process. The estrogenic pesticide methoxychlor and antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin were used. Previous studies have shown that methoxychlor and vinclozolin both interfere with embryonic testis cord formation and cause increased spermatogenic cell apoptosis in the adult testis. Interestingly, transient in vivo exposure to endocrine disruptors at the time of male sex determination caused a transgenerational phenotype (F1-F4) of spermatogenic cell apoptosis and subfertility. This apparent epigenetic mechanism involves altered DNA methylation and permanent re-programming of the male germ-line. A series of genes with altered DNA methylation and imprinting are being identified. Observations reviewed demonstrate that a transient embryonic in utero exposure to an endocrine disruptor influences the embryonic testis transcriptome and through epigenetic effects (e.g., DNA methylation) results in abnormal germ-cell differentiation that subsequently influences adult spermatogenic capacity and male fertility, and that this phenotype is transgenerational through the germ-line. The novel observations of transgenerational epigenetic endocrine disruptor actions on male reproduction critically impact the potential hazards of these compounds as environmental toxins. The literature reviewed provides insight into the molecular and cellular control of embryonic testis development, male sex determination, and the programming of the male germ-line.",1

Group W showed little change in physique, behaviour or learning, indicating that for recovery to be effective refeeding must begin earlier. 3. Group F just failed to attain full physical recovery (90%) whereas group P overgrew by 18.6% in weight and 8.5%; in length. 4. In a test designed to evaluate learning ability rehabilitated rats of groups P and F were significantly less successful than normal rats, but more successful than rats of group W or rats of the original undernourished colony. 5.

,"A general practice comparative study of a new third-generation oral cephalosporin, cefixime, with amoxycillin in the treatment of acute paediatric otitis media.","A total of 325 eligible paediatric patients were entered into an open, randomised, multicentre general practice study to assess the comparative efficacy of a new third-generation oral cephalosporin, cefixime, with respect to that of amoxycillin in the treatment of acute otitis media. The dose of cefixime was 100 mg once daily (six months to five years), 200 mg once daily (five to 10 years) and 300 mg once daily (10 to 16 years). The dose of amoxycillin was as currently used by the participating general practitioners: 62.5 mg tds (six months to one year), 125 mg tds (one to seven years) and 250 mg tds (seven to 16 years). Both were in the form of an oral suspension. The two groups (160 patients on cefixime and 165 on amoxycillin) were comparable at study entry with respect to all parameters assessed. Overall there was a 95 per cent favourable clinical response seen in both groups (95 per cent confidence limits: 92 and 98 per cent respectively). Adverse events were comparable in both groups, except that there were more gastrointestinal side effects seen with cefixime (13 per cent) compared with amoxycillin (4 per cent), but only three patients in each group had to be withdrawn because of side effects. These results demonstrate that cefixime given once daily is a safe and effective alternative to amoxycillin in the treatment of acute otitis media in children, and also has the advantage of less frequent dosing.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/138955710791383974,Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: A Paradigm for Therapeutic Options in Solid Organ Tumors,"Although a relatively rare malignancy with a national incidence of 3500-4000 annually, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) is of significance in the realm of clinical and pharmacological research. GIST exhibits remarkable uniformity in its pathogenesis and ultrastructure as 95% of cases are linked to constitutive activation and overexpression of a membrane tyrosine kinase, c-KIT (CD117). Although previously refractory to any course of action but surgery, GIST heralded a triumph in targeted cancer therapy when administration of a specific first-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor Imatinib mesylate (STI571) was shown to inhibit c-Kit and demonstrated a significant increase in patient survival. Over the subsequent decade, GIST has become a paradigm for the potency of Imatinib in adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, showcasing the clinical relevance and rapidity of translational research in the field of targeted molecular therapy. Subsequent to demonstrating the efficacy of Imatinib as a therapeutic agent, GIST has also exposed the limitations of current targeted therapies. Within two years, 50% of GISTs develop secondary mutations that allow resistance to Imatinib. However, extensive research regarding both primary and secondary c-KIT mutations has illuminated the mechanisms of Imatinib resistance and has the potential to ameliorate this therapeutic setback. Current research to this end lies in two primary directions: the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (some of which also inhibit other oncogenic agents such as PDGFR, bcr-abl, and VEGF) that are either generally more potent than Imatinib or less susceptible to specific mechanisms of resistance; and drugs that target the downstream effectors of the mutant c-KIT kinase, including PKC and mTOR. This paper will systematically review current research on second-generation targeted molecular therapy in the treatment of GIST, and expand upon its value as a model for treatment of other solid organ tumors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.09.001,What is an epigenetic transgenerational phenotype?,"The ability of an environmental exposure to induce an epigenetic transgenerational adult onset disease phenotype is discussed in the current mini-review in the context of defining this phenomenon and the associated reproductive toxicology. A gestating female (F0 generation) exposure to an environmental compound results in the F1 generation embryo and F2 generation germ-line being directly exposed, such that the F3 generation is the first not directly exposed to the environmental compound. In contrast, postnatal or adult exposure (F0 generation) results in the F1 generation germ-line being exposed, such that F2 generation is the first to not be directly exposed to the environmental compound. The unequivocal transgenerational transmission of an adult onset disease phenotype through the germ-line requires assessment of the F3 generation for embryonic exposure, and F2 generation for postnatal exposure. This is in contrast to a number of F1 and F2 generation studies referred to as transgenerational. The reproductive toxicology associated with this transgenerational phenotype generally involves the reprogramming of the germ-line epigenome. The biological phenomenon involved in this reproductive toxicology deals with embryonic gonadal development and germ-line differentiation, or postnatally the gametogenesis process and germ cell development. The ability of an environmental compound (e.g. endocrine disruptor) to promote this reprogramming of the germ-line appears to be the causal factor in the epigenetic transgenerational phenotype.",1

The compound binds to DNA, as measured by UV, fluorescence, and circular dichroism studies, and stabilizes the double helix and higher order DNA structures (DNA triplexes and quadruplexes) against thermal denaturation. Unlike many DNA ligands, (6) shows no specificity for binding to specific base pair combinations and does not inhibit topoisomerase I (topo I) or topo II activity. Furthermore, the biological fingerprint elicited by (6) in in vitro evaluations does not compare with clinical agents of the topo II inhibition class. The compound provokes cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage and the biological sequelae are dependent on the p53 status of the cell line. DNA damage by (6) upregulates p53 and p21(CIP/WAF1) proteins. The unusual structure of (6) and its ease of synthesis in a ""one-pot"" reaction are features that are being exploited in the design and development of a new series of G-quadruplex stabilizing telomerase inhibitors.

As expected there was a high incidence of lung tumours (TBA%) in the F1-generation of mice treated with BP (53.9 vs. 15.4% in control in females and 77.6 vs. 8.0% in control in males). The percentage of TBA was not increased (with one exception) in both males and females of F2-F5 generations which were not directly exposed to carcinogen. Tumor multiplicity increase occurred not only in the F1 generation of BP-treated mice but in both males and females of F2-F5 generations of mice which were not in direct contact with the carcinogen. This increase was statistically significant. There was a slight negative trend within F2-F5 generation of BP-treated mice which however was not significant. Thus the transgenerational carcinogenic effect manifested in a greater tumour multiplicity persisted for four unexposed generations.,1
,[Ornidazole in digestive surgery and surgical intensive care (author's transl)].,"The authors test the effectiveness of ornidazole in digestive surgery and surgical reanimation.

Ornidazole was used for a one year period as either a curative or prophylactic treatment. The product is very well tolerated. During the year the authors noted a decreased frequency of bacteroides bacteremia. They highly recommend the association of penicillin G in traumatology to fight gram negative anaerobic bacilli and numerous gram positive bacteria. The association with gentamycin is justified in the presence of an anaerobic gram negative digestive flora. The use of third generation antibiotics has often proved to be futile. It is recommended that they be reserved for the most resistant organisms seen in primary extra-hospital infections. The prescription of ornidazole must procede and follow the surgical eradication of focal intra-abdominal infections, especially if it is an infection of appendicular origine.",0

Here, a novel operating mode is suggested, which can generate pure linearly polarized photons with very low on-axis heat load. Also the available minimum photon energy of linearly polarized photons can be extended much by this method.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021842,Influence of Early Stress on Social Abilities and Serotonergic Functions across Generations in Mice,"Exposure to adverse environments during early development is a known risk factor for several psychiatric conditions including antisocial behavior and personality disorders. Here, we induced social anxiety and altered social recognition memory in adult mice using unpredictable maternal separation and maternal stress during early postnatal life. We show that these social defects are not only pronounced in the animals directly subjected to stress, but are also transmitted to their offspring across two generations. The defects are associated with impaired serotonergic signaling, in particular, reduced 5HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and increased serotonin level in a dorsal raphe projection area. These findings underscore the susceptibility of social behaviors and serotonergic pathways to early stress, and the persistence of their perturbation across generations.",1

This study was carried out to investigate possible impact of sildenafil; the prototype phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor used for treatment of ED, on the beneficial hemodynamic and histopathological effects of the prototype third generation calcium antagonist, amlodipine, in nitric oxide (NO)-deficient hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced by 4-weeks treatment with N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (l-NAME). Animals were allocated into five groups: normal control, hypertensive control, amlodipine-treated group, sildenafil-treated group and combined treatment group. Drug treatment was started 2 weeks after l-NAME and continued together with l-NAME to the end of the treatment period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma nitrate/nitrite (NO(x)) and plasma cGMP levels were evaluated at the end of the treatment period. Aortic and renal structural alterations were also investigated. l-NAME treatment caused elevation of SBP, reduction in plasma NO(x) and cGMP levels as well as adverse histological alterations in the tissues studied. Amlodipine normalized SBP, restored plasma NO(x) and cGMP levels and ameliorated the adverse histological changes seen in NO-deficient rats. When combined with sildenafil, both hemodynamic and histopathological effects of amlodipine were augmented with an underlying enhanced elevation of both plasma NO(x) and cGMP levels to statistically higher values than amlodipine alone. These results show that sildenafil augments the beneficial hemodynamic and histopathological effects of amlodipine in NO-deficient hypertensive rats with a pivotal role being played by NO-cGMP pathway. Whether this pharmacodynamic interaction could exist in other models of hypertension that do not share such biochemical derangement warrants further investigations.",0

These strains of engineered non-virulent Salmonella typhimurium display the capacity to accumulate and grow selectively in a variety of tumor types and to inhibit the growth of primary and metastatic tumors following intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice. One strain of the bacteria (VNP20009) which has endogenous antitumor activity is currently in Phase I clinical trials. The bacteria are highly attenuated and genetically stable. The combination of the lipid mutation and the purine auxotrophy attenuate the virulence of the bacteria by greater than 10000-fold and enhance the specificity of the bacteria for tumor tissue. These bacteria have been found to be safe in mice, pigs and monkeys when administered intravenously. Second-generation Salmonella vectors will be developed to include transgenes that will express therapeutic agents and reporter transgenes for non-invasive imaging. We have performed a preliminary study to demonstrate localization of [(14)C]FIAU in tumored mice pretreated with Salmonella expressing HSV1-TK. The [(14)C]FIAU radioactivity and bacterial count data strongly support a Salmonella(TK)-dependent [(14)C]FIAU accumulation of at least 30-fold higher in tumor tissue compared to muscle tissue. These data warrant further investigation on the use of genetically engineered Salmonella as a systemically administered tumor-specific agents for tumor therapy and delivery of diagnostic imaging markers.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s16077,Role of sublingual asenapine in treatment of schizophrenia,"Asenapine tablets are a new option for the treatment of schizophrenia. Sublingual administration is essential because bioavailability if ingested is less than 2%. Efficacy is supported by acute and long-term randomized controlled studies conducted by the manufacturer, with asenapine 5 mg twice daily evidencing superiority over placebo in six-week studies of acute schizophrenia, and flexibly-dosed asenapine (modal dose 10 mg twice daily) superior to placebo in a 26-week maintenance of response study. Tolerability advantages over some second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, include a relatively favorable weight and metabolic profile, as demonstrated in a 52-week randomized, head-to-head, double-blind clinical trial. Although dose-related extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia can be present, the frequency of these effects is lower than that for haloperidol and risperidone. Somnolence may also occur, and appears to be somewhat dose-dependent when examining rates of this among patients receiving asenapine for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Prolactin elevation can occur, but at a rate lower than that observed for haloperidol or risperidone. Unique to asenapine is the possibility of oral hypoesthesia, occurring in about 5% of participants in the clinical trials. Obstacles to the use of asenapine are the recommendations for twice-daily dosing and the need to avoid food or liquids for 10 minutes after administration, although the bioavailability is only minimally reduced if food or liquids are avoided for only two minutes.",0

Examples of hybrid vigour or hybrid necrosis in the F1 are often not inherited stably in subsequent generations if they are associated with overdominance. There can also be transgressive phenotypes that are inherited stably in these later generations, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we have investigated the possibility that stable transgressive phenotypes in the progeny of crosses between cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82) and a wild relative (Solanum pennellii, accession LA716) are associated with micro or small interfering(si) RNAs. We identified loci from which these small(s)RNAs were more abundant in hybrids than in either parent and we show that accumulation of such transgressive sRNAs correlated with suppression of the corresponding target genes. In one instance this effect was associated with hypermethylation of the corresponding genomic DNA. Our results illustrate a potential role of transgressive sRNAs in plant breeding and in natural evolution with wild plants.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.08.012,"HuCAL PLATINUM, a Synthetic Fab Library Optimized for Sequence Diversity and Superior Performance in Mammalian Expression Systems","This article describes the design of HuCAL (human combinatorial antibody library) PLATINUM, an optimized, second-generation, synthetic human Fab antibody library with six trinucleotide-randomized complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Major improvements regarding the optimized antibody library sequence space were implemented. Sequence space optimization is considered a multistep process that includes the analysis of unproductive antibody sequences in order to, for example, avoid motifs such as potential N-glycosylation sites, which are undesirable in antibody production. Gene optimization has been used to improve expression of the antibody master genes in the library context. As a result, full-length IgGs derived from the library show both significant improvements in expression levels and less undesirable glycosylation sites when compared to the previous HuCAL GOLD library. Additionally, in-depth analysis of sequences from public databases revealed that diversity of CDR-H3 is a function of loop length. Based upon this analysis, the relatively uniform diversification strategy used in the CDR-H3s of the previous HuCAL libraries was changed to a length-dependent design, which replicates the natural amino acid distribution of CDR-H3 in the human repertoire. In a side-by-side comparison of HuCAL GOLD and HuCAL PLATINUM, the new library concept led to isolation of about fourfold more unique sequences and to a higher number of high-affinity antibodies. In the majority of HuCAL PLATINUM projects, 100-300 antibodies each having different CDR-H3s are obtained against each antigen. This increased diversity pool has been shown to significantly benefit functional antibody profiling and screening for superior biophysical properties.",0

Episodes were classified according to the place of acquisition: community, healthcare system, or nosocomial. <h3>Results</h3> Two hundred and forty-six episodes were analyzed in 200 patients (150 males, 57.3years): 34.6% community-acquired, 38.6% healthcare system-acquired, and 26.8% nosocomially-acquired. Third-generation cephalosporin resistance occurred in 21.5% (7.1% community-acquired, 21.1% healthcare system-acquired, 40.9% nosocomially-acquired). These resistant cases were categorized as extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli, other resistant Gram-negative bacilli, and <i>Enterococci</i>. Risk factors for resistance were previous use of cephalosporins, diabetes mellitus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nosocomial acquisition, and a low polymorphonuclear count in ascites. Regarding third-generation cephalosporin resistance, adequate empirical treatment was 80.7%. Independent predictors of mortality were nosocomial acquisition, poor hepato-renal function, immunosuppressive therapy, a marked inflammatory response during the episode and either third-generation cephalosporin-resistance or low rates of adequate empirical treatment. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The risk of third-generation cephalosporin resistance was particularly high in nosocomially-acquired episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but also occurred in healthcare system-acquired cases. The extent of resistance and the adequacy of empirical antibiotics had a significant effect on mortality along with the patient's hepato-renal function. These data can help determine the most suitable empirical antimicrobial treatments in these patients.",0

It also plays a significant role in nosocomial ear infection in children, while it causes pneumonia with or without bacteremia in hospitalized elderly people. Multiple antibiotic resistant strains are prevalent among S. pneumoniae isolates from the respiratory tract of hospitalized patients in Hungary. This fact makes therapeutic reconsiderations concerning the use of oral beta-lactams mandatory. In this retrospective study two nosocomial outbreaks caused by multiresistant S. pneumoniae in two pediatric hospitals are described. The patients admitted with a chronic underlying disease (milk intolerance and gastro-oesophageal reflux were predominant) or respiratory tract infection acquired acute otitis media. Therapy with oral beta-lactams (first and second generation cephalosporins and amoxicillin), macrolides and co-trimoxazole was ineffective in most of the cases or resulted in transient improvement. In some cases acute otitis media resolved with the improvement of the underlying condition, in two cases administration of cefotaxime resulted in recovery and in one case mastoidectomy became necessary.",0
https://doi.org/10.1006/rtph.1997.1194,The Health Canada Great Lakes Multigeneration Study—Summary and Regulatory Considerations,"The Health Canada Multigeneration Study was initiated to determine the consequences in rodents consuming diets containing Lake Ontario (LO) or Lake Huron (LH) chinook salmon over successive generations. Following lyophilization, the contaminant levels in the salmon used in the formulation of the diets for this study exceeded a number of tolerances or guidelines established for contaminants in commercial fish and seafood products (PCBs, dioxin, mirex, chlordanes, mercury). Consumption of the fish diets by rats of two consecutive generations resulted in a variety of effects that can be described as adaptive responses or of limited biological significance. The two exceptions to this were (1) the suggestion of modification of working and reference memory in males of the high-dose groups 20% fish diets, which may have been related to decreases noted in neurotransmitters in several brain regions in these rats; and (2) an effect on thymus weights noted in the high-dose first generation (F1) reversibility study animals and an overall effect on T-helper/inducer lymphocyte subset numbers in the second generation (F2) male rats fed the LH diets compared to the LO diets. Relatively minor effects were observed in the rats consuming the 5% fish diets from either Great Lakes location (LH-5, LH-5), although their fish intake was approximately 16-fold greater on a daily basis than the average angler consuming Great Lakes sport fish (compared to a 60-fold greater intake in the 20% diet groups: LH-20, LO-20). Based on these study results with rats it would appear that for the average consumer of Great Lakes sports fish, the risk presented by the complex mixture of contaminants in chinook salmon collected from these two locations in the Great Lakes basin could be considered minimal, especially if sport fish consumption advisories are followed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jemt.20715,"The dynamic epigenetic program in male germ cells: Its role in spermatogenesis, testis cancer, and its response to the environment","Spermatogenesis is a truly remarkable process that requires exquisite control and synchronization of germ cell development. It is prone to frequent error, as paternal infertility contributes to 30–50% of all infertility cases; yet, in many cases, the mechanisms underlying its causes are unknown. Strikingly, aberrant epigenetic profiles, in the form of anomalous DNA and histone modifications, are characteristic of cancerous testis cells. Germ cell development is a critical period during which epigenetic patterns are established and maintained. The progression from diploid spermatogonia to haploid spermatozoa involves stage- and testis-specific gene expression, mitotic and meiotic division, and the histone–protamine transition. All are postulated to engender unique epigenetic controls. In support of this idea are the findings that mouse models with gene deletions for epigenetic modifiers have severely compromised fertility. Underscoring the importance of understanding how epigenetic marks are set and interpreted is evidence that abnormal epigenetic programming of gametes and embryos contributes to heritable instabilities in subsequent generations. Numerous studies have documented the existence of transgenerational consequences of maternal nutrition, or other environmental exposures, but it is only now recognized that there are sex-specific male-line transgenerational responses in humans and other species. Epigenetic events in the testis have just begun to be studied. New work on the function of specific histone modifications, chromatin modifiers, DNA methylation, and the impact of the environment on developing sperm suggests that the correct setting of the epigenome is required for male reproductive health and the prevention of paternal disease transmission.

https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1371.020,Adverse Health Effects of Fluoro-Edenitic Fibers: Epidemiological Evidence and Public Health Priorities,"Subsequent to the detection of a cluster of mesothelioma cases in the Sicilian town of Biancavilla, located at the slopes of Etna volcano, ad hoc epidemiological studies and environmental monitoring suggested an etiological role of an asbestiform fiber present in a stone quarry. The fiber was shown to constitute a new mineral species named fluoro-edenite. Fluoro-edenitic fibers were found in the materials extracted from the quarry and used in the local building industry, as well as in soils. Besides the risk of mesothelioma, residents in Biancavilla showed a significantly increased mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was particularly evident among women. In the light of these findings, Biancavilla was defined a site of national interest for environmental reclamation. The first preventive action involved termination of quarrying activity, covering with asphalt of roads previously paved with local soil materials, and removal of sources of dust in the urban area. Concurrent to the implementation of environmental cleanup, some specific ""second generation"" studies are now being designed and performed, namely morbidity surveys based on hospital discharge cards, monitoring of fibers in sputum and health surveillance in selected population groups. In this frame, special emphasis is given to the issue of communication, both to the general public and to target groups like family doctors, teachers, and media professionals. This experience could represent a useful basis for the elaboration of a strategy to approach similar environmental issues.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/des030,Diet-induced paternal obesity in the absence of diabetes diminishes the reproductive health of two subsequent generations of mice,"Obesity and related conditions, notably subfertility, are increasingly prevalent. Paternal influences are known to influence offspring health outcome, but the impact of paternal obesity and subfertility on the reproductive health of subsequent generations has been overlooked.A high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce obesity but not diabetes in male C57Bl6 mice, which were subsequently mated to normal-weight females. First-generation offspring were raised on a control diet and their gametes were investigated for signs of subfertility. Second-generation offspring were generated from both first generation sexes and their gametes were similarly assessed.We demonstrate a HFD-induced paternal initiation of subfertility in both male and female offspring of two generations of mice. Furthermore, we have shown that diminished reproductive and gamete functions are transmitted through the first generation paternal line to both sexes of the second generation and via the first generation maternal line to second-generation males. Our previous findings that founder male obesity alters the epigenome of sperm, could provide a basis for the developmental programming of subfertility in subsequent generations.This is the first observation of paternal transmission of diminished reproductive health to future generations and could have significant implications for the transgenerational amplification of subfertility observed worldwide in humans.",1
,[A family of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I with a new type of myelin P0 mutation].,"A 26-year-old man had complaints of insidiously progressive muscle weakness of the legs, worse in the right leg than in the left. Slight to moderate degrees of asymmetrical muscular atrophy and weakness of the distal lower limb muscles, greater in the right leg than in the left, without fasciculation, were also observed. Pes equinovarus deformity of both feet was obvious. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased in the upper limbs and absent in the lower limbs, without pathologic reflexes. Vibratory sensation was moderately decreased in the toes. The right median and tibial motor nerve conduction velocities were 19.4 and 10.5 m/sec, respectively, with a markedly prolonged distal latency. No nerve action potentials were elicited from stimulation of the right and left sural nerves. A fascicular biopsy of the right sural nerve was performed. The myelinated fibers showing segmental de- and remyelination were frequently found in teased fiber preparations. Both demyelinated and remyelinated axons and onion-bulbs were frequently observed by light and electron microscopy in the Epon-embedded sections. Based on the neurological examinations and nerve conduction studies of the family members, an elder brother, father and grandmother of the proband were found to be affected by polyneuropathy. However, the mother, an uncle, an aunt, and a cousin of the proband were normal.

As an arterial-selective vasodilator, clevidipine reduces peripheral vascular resistance directly, without dilating the venous capacitance bed. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of clevidipine in treating preoperative hypertension.One-hundred-fifty-two patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with current or recent hypertension were randomized to receive clevidipine or placebo preoperatively. One-hundred-five patients met postrandomization entrance criteria (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > or =160 mm Hg after inserting an arterial catheter) for reduction by > or =15% from baseline in SBP. The patients thus received infusions of clevidipine (0.4-8.0 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or 20% lipid emulsion (placebo) for at least 30 min. Treatment failure was defined as failure to reduce SBP by > or =15% from baseline or discontinuance of drug for any reason.Patients treated with clevidipine demonstrated a 92.5% rate of treatment success and a significantly lower rate of treatment failure (7.5%, 4 of 53) than patients receiving placebo (82.7%, 43 of 52; P < 0.0001). Clevidipine achieved target blood pressures (SBP reduced by > or =15%) at a median of 6.0 min (95% confidence interval 6-8 min). A modest increase in heart rate from baseline occurred during clevidipine administration. Adverse events for each treatment group were similar.Clevidipine was effective in rapidly decreasing blood pressure preoperatively to targeted blood pressure levels and was well tolerated in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery.",0

This study was done to test the hypothesis that mixed density of TEH detected by third or fourth generation CT correlated with the type of bleeding or clinical outcome. All cases of TEH operated at Detroit Receiving Hospital from 1991-1997 were reviewed for type of bleeding (active vs. not active; arterial vs. venous); Glasgow Coma Scale (severe 1-8, not severe 9-15); and Glasgow Outcome Score (1-3 poor; 4,5 good). CT density (CTD) of 51 cases with specific written documentation of bleeding type were then independently reviewed (SKS and MHR) and classified into TEH with mixed or high density. Data was analyzed using corrected Chi Square analysis, Fischer's Exact Test and Pearson's Correlation (SPSS 6.0). The Pearson Chi Square probability for correlation follows: CTD vs. active bleeding, 0.21; CTD vs. arterial, 0.41; CTD vs. severity, 0.57; and CTD vs. outcome, 0.81. No other statistical analysis identified a significant correlation, thus the null hypothesis could not be rejected. CT mixed density was not found to be correlated by more than chance with bleeding type, injury severity or outcome. Surgeon inaccuracy in documentation of bleeding type and use of later generation CT may account for the discrepancy between this and previous studies. Nevertheless, we conclude clinical exam and other published CT criteria are better indicators of injury severity and outcome. [Neurol Res 2002; 24: 125-128]",0

We show here that the viRNA-mediated viral silencing effect is transmitted in a non-Mendelian manner to many ensuing generations. We show that the viral silencing agents, viRNAs, are transgenerationally transmitted in a template-independent manner and work in trans to silence viral genomes present in animals that are deficient in producing their own viRNAs. These results provide evidence for the transgenerational inheritance of an acquired trait, induced by the exposure of animals to a specific, biologically relevant physiological challenge.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that mtDNA polymorphisms (mtSNPs) or haplogroups may modify the risk of developing PD. Here, we determined the distributions of ten mtSNPs that define the nine major European haplogroups among 224 PD patients and 383 controls from Crete, an island of 0.6 million inhabitants who share a similar genetic background and a common environment. The recruitment of patients and controls was restricted to individuals of Cretan origin for at least three generations from both parental sides in order to avoid population admixture and subsequent genetic heterogeneity. We found no mtSNP or mtDNA haplogroup that predisposes to PD, although there was a trend for haplogroups J, T, U and I and the supercluster of haplogroups UKJT to be slightly underrepresented in our PD patients as compared to controls. While a combination of common mtSNPs (present in >or=5% of the general population) may decrease the chance of developing PD, this effect was minor in the Cretan population.",0
,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer generally has an unfavorable prognosis. For those with resectable disease, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has the potential to reduce tumor volume, address micrometastatic disease early, and improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing neoadjuvant platinum-based regimens with surgery alone were able to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this modality. These trials supported evidence found in phase II trials that utilized third-generation chemotherapies. Still, limitations to these studies exist, such as the inclusion of various disease stages in one study, inter- and intratrial variability of the chemotherapy regimens used, and lack of phase III data comparing neoadjuvant to adjuvant chemotherapy. These heterogeneous factors make it difficult to offer firm recommendations about neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other matters of contention include the role of postoperative radiation and the concern for increased postoperative complications, especially when a right pneumonectomy is being considered after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To clarify these issues, well-structured phase III trials comparing adjuvant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are needed.",0

The first encounter with a hormone in higher dose provokes the phenomenon of hormonal imprinting, by which the reaction of the cell is quantitatively modified. This modification is transmitted to the progeny generations. The duration of the single imprinter effect of two representative signal molecules, insulin and 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine), in two concentrations (10(-6) and 10(-15) M) were studied. The effects of imprinting were followed in 5 physiological indices: (i) insulin binding, (ii) 5-HT synthesis, (iii) swimming behaviour, (iv) cell growth and (v) chemotaxis in progeny generations 500 and 1000. The result of each index was different from the non-imprinted control functions, growth rate, swimming behaviour and chemotactic activity to insulin being enhanced, while others, e.g. synthesis and chemotactic responsiveness of 5-HT and the binding of insulin were reduced. This means that a function-specific heritable epigenetic change during imprinting occurs, and generally a single encounter with a femtomolar hormone concentration is enough for provoking durable and heritable imprinting in Tetrahymena. The experiments demonstrate the possibility of epigenetic effects at a unicellular level and call attention to the possibility that the character of unicellular organisms has changed through to the present day due to an enormous amount of non-physiological imprinter substances in their environment. The results - together with results obtained earlier in mammals - point to the validity of epigenetic imprinting effects throughout the animal world.",1
https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.13.1.121,Tailored therapy for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: results of a phase II study with a long-term follow-up.,"Aim of the study was to improve cure rate and survival of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with a tailored program of therapy based on histologic type, prognostic characteristics of patients and response to therapy, and with the use of differentiating or cytostatic agents such as Ara-C at low doses and alphaIFN. Fifty-four consecutive patients with aggressive NHL were treated in the induction phase with 4 sequential courses of a third generation regimen (modified CODBLAM IV), followed in responsive patients by 1 cycle of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and 1 cycle of high dose methotrexate with folinic acid rescue (AC-MTX). Patients who achieved partial response (PR) were treated with the combination of CCNU + vinblastine if affected by high grade NHL, or with low dose Ara-C plus alphaIFN if affected by intermediate grade NHL. Patients who obtained complete response (CR) with basal adverse prognostic factors were treated with alphaIFN as maintenance therapy for two years. Radiotherapy and surgery were effected in selected cases. Thirty-four patients (62.9%) achieved CR and 12 patients (22.2%) showed PR after induction therapy. Among the 12 patients who achieved PR, 6 prolonged CRs were obtained in 7 patients treated with Ara-C at low doses plus alphaIFN and 4 CRs were obtained in 5 patients treated with CCNU + vinblastine. After completion of treatment, 44 patients (81.5%) obtained CR, 2 patients (3.7%) showed PR and 8 patients (14.8%) presented progression of disease (PD). Fifteen patients received alphaIFN as maintenance therapy. The overall survival and failure-free survival rates are 53.7% and 50% respectively, with a median follow-up of 82 months: 27 patients remain alive, disease-free without relapses, and can be considered cured. This tailored program of therapy resulted effective and moderately toxic and may improve the outcome in aggressive NHL.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2011.03.011,"Évolution de la sensibilité aux antibiotiques de Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa et Acinetobacter baumanii dans un CHU de Beyrouth entre 2005 et 2009","Les bactéries multirésistantes constituent désormais un problème majeur de santé publique. Plusieurs mécanismes sont à la base de cette multirésistance aux antibiotiques. L’inactivation enzymatique reste cependant le mécanisme prépondérant et en particulier la production de bêtalactamases. D’importance notable sont les bêtalactamases à spectre étendu (BLSE) d’ Escherichia coli et de Klebsiella pneumoniae médiant la résistance aux céphalosporines de troisième génération et à l’aztréonam (AZT). L’association de multiples mécanismes de résistance (efflux, imperméabilité, inactivation enzymatique) crée à son tour des bactéries multirésistantes comme par exemple Pseudomonas aeruginosa BMR et Acinetobacter baumanii BMR. Alors qu’elles étaient limitées à l’environnement hospitalier, ces bactéries multirésistantes sont devenues un problème majeur d’infections communautaires touchant des personnes ayant peu ou pas de contact avec l’environnement hospitalier. Le but de l’étude est de suivre sur cinq ans l’évolution des sensibilités aux antibiotiques de quatre bacilles à Gram négatif (BGN) communément impliqués dans les infections nosocomiales à bactéries multi résistantes : E. coli , K. pneumoniae , P. aeruginosa et A. baumanii , dans un centre hospitalier universitaire de Beyrouth, entre 2005 et 2009. La sensibilité des souches isolées de malades non hospitalisés a été également étudiée. Les différentes souches bactériennes ont été classées selon leur provenance de malades hospitalisés ou non, selon qu’elles soient productrices de BLSE (pour E. coli et K. pneumoniae ) ou qu’elles soient des BMR (pour P. aeruginosa et A. baumanii ). Les sensibilités respectives aux antibiotiques ont été retirées de la base de données informatique de l’hôpital. La comparaison des pourcentages de sensibilité a été réalisée par z -test sur logiciel informatique. Pour Escherichia coli on avait recensé en 2009 une totalité de 2541 souches dont 773 étaient productrices de BLSE ou 30,4 % contre 2031 souches en 2005 dont 361 productrices de BLSE ou 17,8 % ( p < 0,001). On avait constaté aussi une diminution de la sensibilité des souches hospitalières au Ceftazidime (CAZ) et à l’AZT entre 2005 et 2009 ( p < 0,001) ainsi qu’une diminution de la sensibilité des souches communautaires au triméthoprime/sulfaméthoxazole (SXT) entre 2005 et 2009 ( p = 0,03). En revanche il y a eu une diminution significative du taux de BLSE entre 2007 et 2009 : 33,4 % contre 30,4 % ( p = 0,03). Pour K. pneumoniae , on avait recensé en 2009 une totalité de 560 souches dont 178 étaient productrices de BLSE ou 31,8 % contre 405 souches en 2005 dont 96 productrices de BLSE ou 23,7 % ( p = 0,03). On avait noté aussi une diminution de la sensibilité des souches hospitalières à la piperacilline-tazobactam (TZP), cefotaxime (CTX) et AZT ( p < 0,001 p = 0,03 et p = 0,03 respectivement) entre 2006 et 2009, et une augmentation sensible du taux de BLSE entre 2008 et 2009 ( p = 0,0001). Pour P. aeruginosa , on avait recensé en 2009 une totalité de 973 souches dont 258 étaient des bacilles multi résistants ou BMR (résistance à plus de trois familles d’antibiotique) ou 26,5 % contre 876 souches en 2005 dont 233 étaient des BMR ou 26,6 % ( p = 0,5) mais avec toutefois une diminution du taux de BMR entre 2008 et 2009 ( p = 0,047). Il y avait aussi diminution de la sensibilité des souches BMR à la CAZ ( p < 0,001) et à l’imipenème (IMP) ( p = 0,003) entre 2005 et 2009. Enfin pour A. baumanii , on avait recensé en 2009 une totalité de 130 souches dont 101 étaient des BMR ou 77,7 % contre 79 souches en 2005 dont 58 étaient des BMR ou 73,4 % ( p = 0,24) avec diminution dramatique de la sensibilité des souches BMR à l’IMP entre 2006 et 2009 de 92,3 % à 30 % ( p < 0,001). Malgré la politique de restriction sur l’usage des antibiotiques et les conditions d’hygiène et d’isolement des patients porteurs de germes multi résistants, il n’y a pas eu une diminution drastique du nombre de souches BMR ou productrices de BLSE. Des efforts supplémentaires devraient être envisagés afin de réduire le pourcentage des bactéries résistantes et multi résistantes de la flore hospitalière. Until recently, multiresistant bacteria were only limited to hospitals. However, they are now responsible for community acquired infections, affecting people who have had no contact with the hospital environment. Several mechanisms are associated with these resistances. The production of betalactamases is however the predominant mechanism and especially the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases or ESBL by strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , which mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam (AZT). The association of multiple mechanisms of resistance (efflux pumps, impermeability and enzymatic inactivation) generates multi resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR and Klebsiella pneumoniae MDR. The aim of the study was to analyze retrospectively the susceptibility to antibiotics of strains of E. coli , K. pneumoniae , P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii isolated from hospitalized and outpatients in a university hospital center of Beirut over a period of five years from 2005 to 2009. Bacterial strains were classified according to their origin (inpatients versus outpatients), their ability to produce or not ESBLs for E. coli and K. pneumonia and if they were MDR for P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii . Antibiotics susceptibilities were retrieved from the informatics database of the hospital. Comparison of susceptibility percentages was done using a unilateral z -test on a computer program. In 2009, 2541 strains of E. coli were isolated, 773 of which or 30.4 % were ESBL producers while 2031 strains were isolated in 2005, of which 361 or 17.8 % were ESBL producers ( p < 0.001). We noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to ceftazidime (CAZ) and AZT, between 2005 and 2009 ( p < 0.001), and a decrease in community strains susceptibility to triméthoprime/sulfaméthoxazole (SXT) between 2005 and 2009 ( p = 0.03). We noted however a significant decrease of ESBL producing strains between 2007 and 2009: 33.4 % versus 30.4 % ( p = 0.03). Among 560 strains of K. pneumoniae isolated in 2009, 178 strains or 31.8 % were ESBL producers in comparison to 23.7 % of the strains isolated in 2005 ( p = 0.03). We also noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to piperacilline-tazobactam (TZP), cefotaxime (CTX) and AZT ( p < 0.001 p = 0.03 and p = 0.03 respectively) between 2006 and 2009, and a significant increase in ESBL producing strains between 2008 et 2009 ( p = 0.0001). 26.5 % of P. aeruginosa strains isolated in 2009 were MDR bacteria with no significant change as compared to 26.6 % in 2005 ( p = 0.5). However, the percentage of MDR strains slightly decreased between 2008 and 2009 ( p = 0.047). The susceptibility of MDR strains to CAZ and imipenem (IMP) decreased between 2005 and 2009 ( p < 0.001 and P = 0.003 respectively). As for A. baumanii , 77.7 % of strains were MDR in 2009 in comparison to 73.4 % in 2005 ( p = 0.24) with a dramatic decrease of MDR strains susceptibility to IMP from 92.3 % in 2006 to 30 % in 2009 ( p < 0.001). Despite restrictions on antibiotics prescriptions and isolation of patients harboring MDR bacteria or bacteria producing ESBL, there has not been satisfactory reduction of multi resistant bacteria and efforts should be made to reduce these bugs from the hospital flora.",0

We recently reported that young high-risk offspring of an affected parent were impaired in both verbal episodic memory (VEM) and visual episodic memory (VisEM). Understanding better the trajectory of memory impairments from childhood to adult clinical status in risk populations is crucial for early detection and prevention. In multigenerational families densely affected by SZ or BP, our aim was to compare the memory impairments observed in young nonaffected offspring with memory functioning in nonaffected adult relatives and patients.For 20 years, we followed up numerous kindreds in the Eastern Québec population. After having characterized the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders phenotypes, we assessed cognition (N = 381) in 3 subsamples in these kindreds and in controls: 60 young offspring of a parent affected by SZ or BP, and in the adult generations, 92 nonaffected adult relatives and 40 patients affected by SZ or BP. VEM was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test and VisEM with the Rey figures.The VEM deficits observed in the offspring were also found in adult relatives and patients. In contrast, the VisEM impairments observed in the young offspring were present only in patients, not in the adult relatives.Implications for prevention and genetic mechanisms can be drawn from the observation that VEM and VisEM would show distinct generational trajectories and that the trajectory associated with VisEM may offer a better potential than VEM to predict future risk of developing the disease.",0

https://doi.org/10.1100/2012/852564,Attitudes Regarding the Use of Ventilator Support Given a Supposed Terminal Condition among Community-Dwelling Mexican American and Non-Hispanic White Older Adults: A Pilot Study,"Purpose . To determine the factors that are associated with Mexican Americans’ preference for ventilator support, given a supposed terminal diagnosis. Methods . 100 Mexican Americans, aged 60–89, were recruited and screened for MMSE scores above 18. Eligible subjects answered a questionnaire in their preferred language (English/Spanish) concerning ventilator use during terminal illness. Mediator variables examined included demographics, generation, religiosity, occupation, self-reported depression, self-reported health, and activities of daily living. Results . Being first or second generation American (OR = 0.18, CI = 0.05–0.66) with no IADL disability (OR = 0.11, CI = 0.02–0.59) and having depressive symptoms (OR = 1.43, CI = 1.08–1.89) were associated with preference for ventilator support. Implications . First and second generation older Mexican Americans and those functionally independent are more likely to prefer end-of-life ventilation support. Although depressive symptoms were inversely associated with ventilator use at the end of life, scores may more accurately reflect psychological stress associated with enduring the scenario. Further studies are needed to determine these factors’ generalizability to the larger Mexican American community.",0

We have been studying preference for umami substances in two systems: inbred mice and human infants. In 48-hr tests, C57BL/6J (C57) mice exhibit a lower preference threshold for MSG than do 129/J mice. Moreover, C57 mice show a greater preference across a wide range of concentrations and, at high (e.g., 300-600 mM) concentrations, consume greater amounts of MSG. To examine whether the strain difference in MSG preference might be related to a similar strain difference in preference for sucrose and other sweeteners, as might be suggested from studies with rats, preferences for MSG and sucrose in the second (F2) generation were examined. Preferences for sucrose and for MSG were not positively correlated in the F2 indicating that these strain differences depend on different genes. For human adults, unlike mice, the taste of aqueous MSG is not palatable. Our studies of human infants also indicate that MSG alone is not preferred to plain water, but, when it is added to soup, the soup plus MSG is preferred to soup alone. Ongoing studies are designed to determine whether simple mixtures of MSG with other tastants, in particular NaCl, are preferred to water alone, NaCl alone, and MSG alone.",0
,[Genetic polymorphisms and new perspectives in the prevention and treatment of obesity].,"The prevalence of obesity has increased to an extraordinary degree, especially over the last three decades, so that if these trends persist, practically all of the adult population would be obese in the course of only two generations. On the basis of family and adoption studies, it has been estimated that the genetic component in obesity ranges from 20% to 80%. Thus, the most common forms of obesity would depend on the interaction of multiple genes as well as on the influence of various environmental factors, such as eating behaviour and lifestyle. Although none of these genes potentially involved in the control of body weight seems to be directly responsible for the syndrome, there have been reports of interesting associations between polymorphisms of certain candidate genes and obesity or its metabolic complications. The studies into associations between genotypes and obese phenotype have increased over the last few years and have basically focussed on the genes involved in the control of the energy balance, giving rise to a whole series of results which might constitute the basis for extremely interesting strategies for the prevention and treatment of this serious problem.",0

Genomic blotting analyses on DNA from affected family members show heterozygosity for a large deletion beginning at least 15 kb upstream of the 5' endpoint of the gamma delta beta-thalassemia-1 deletion, extending through the entire beta-like globin gene cluster, and continuing for at least 10 kb beyond the 3' endpoint of the deletion associated with the Spanish form of delta beta 0-thalassemia. This deletion is among the largest described so far, and removes at least 205 kb encompassing the entire beta-like globin gene cluster on chromosome 11.",0

Therefore, we sought to determine how often NNRTI-resistant mutations other than K103N occur as minority variants in plasma samples for which standard genotypic resistance testing detects K103N alone.We performed ultradeep pyrosequencing (UDPS; 454 Life Sciences a Roche Company, Branford, CT) of plasma virus samples from 13 treatment-naive and 20 NNRTI-experienced patients in whom standard genotypic resistance testing revealed K103N but no other major NNRTI-resistance mutations.Samples from 0 of 13 treatment-naive patients vs. 7 of 20 patients failing an NNRTI-containing regimen had minority variants with major etravirine-associated NNRTI-resistant mutations (P = 0.03, Fisher exact test): Y181C (7.0%), Y181C (3.6%) + G190A (3.2%), L100I (14%), L100I (32%) + 190A (5.4%), K101E (3.8%) + G190A (4.9%), K101E (4.0%) + G190S (4.8%), and G190S (3.1%).In treatment-naive patients, UDPS did not detect additional major NNRTI-resistant mutations suggesting that etravirine may be effective in patients with transmitted K103N. In NNRTI-experienced patients, UDPS often detected additional major NNRTI-resistant mutations suggesting that etravirine may not be fully active in patients with acquired K103N.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/03014460802154777,Age at menarche of three-generation families in Taiwan,"Menarche is a critical transition and biological event for women. Age at menarche is an important variable for women's health and appears to be decreasing from generation to generation.This study describes the distributions of recalled age at menarche of women in three-generation families, examines generational differences, and evaluates the effects of birth mothers' and birth grandmothers' recalled age at menarche on their daughters.This cross-sectional investigation was performed on 214 post-adolescent girls from central Taiwan and their birth mothers and grandmothers. The descriptive analysis, analyses of mixed effect models, and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to examine the relationships of age at menarche for three generations within families.The distribution of age at menarche moved significantly earlier over the three generations. The mean ages at menarche were 15.16 +/- 1.75, 14.50 +/- 1.50, and 13.00 +/- 1.26 years for grandmothers, mothers, and daughters, respectively. Four factors for the daughters' age at menarche (adjusted for age at the time of the study and geographical location) were identified. The first three were reinforcing effects. These were the product of the mothers' and grandmothers' ages at menarche, the product of the mothers' geographical locations and ages at menarche, and the product of the grandmothers' ethnicity and ages at menarche. The fourth factor was the grandmothers' ethnicity.The results showed a significant decrease in the onset age of menstruation over three generations, with a positive effect on age at menarche from mothers to daughters and from grandmothers to granddaughters.",1

https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.mct-06-0417,Hsp27 knockdown using nucleotide-based therapies inhibit tumor growth and enhance chemotherapy in human bladder cancer cells,"Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is a cytoprotective chaperone that is phosphoactivated during cell stress that prevents aggregation and/or regulate activity and degradation of certain client proteins. Recent evidence suggests that Hsp27 may be involved in tumor progression and the development of treatment resistance in various tumors, including bladder cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine, both in vitro and in vivo, the effects of overexpression of Hsp27 and, correspondingly, the down-regulation of Hsp27 using small interfering (si) RNA and OGX-427, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide targeting Hsp27. Hsp27 overexpression increased UMUC-3 cell growth and resistance to paclitaxel. Both OGX-427 and Hsp27 siRNA decreased Hsp27 protein and mRNA levels by >90% in a dose- and sequence-specific manner in human bladder cancer UMUC-3 cells. OGX-427 or Hsp27 siRNA treatment induced apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel in UMUC-3 cells. In vivo, OGX-427 significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice, enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel, and induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis compared with xenografts treated with control oligonucleotides. Collectively, these findings suggest that Hsp27 knockdown with OGX-427 and combined therapy with paclitaxel could be a novel strategy to inhibit the progression of bladder cancer.",0

However, much less is known about third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation application in high-level athletes. We report on the two-year follow-up outcome after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation to treat a large cartilage lesion of the lateral femoral condyle in a male Caucasian professional football player.Case presentationA 27-year-old male Caucasian professional football player was previously treated for cartilage problems of his left knee with two failed microfracture procedures resulting in a 9 cm2 Outerbridge Grade 4 chondral lesion at his lateral femoral condyle. Preoperative Tegner-Lysholm and Brittberg-Peterson scores were 64 and 58, and by the second year they were 91 and 6. An evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated filling of the defect with the signal intensity of the repair tissue resembling healthy cartilage. Second-look arthroscopy revealed robust, smooth cartilage covering his lateral femoral condyle. He returned to his former competitive level without restrictions or complaints one year after the procedure.ConclusionsThis case illustrates that robust cartilage tissue can be obtained with a matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure even after two failed microfracture procedures in a large (9 cm2) cartilage defect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the application of the third-generation cell therapy treatment technique, matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation, in a professional football player.",0
,[Dentin adhesives. An update].,"Even if mechanical bonding to enamel utilizing the acid-etch technique has been very successful, adhesion to dentin is still a challenge to researchers and clinicians. Dentin is a vital tissue and differs in composition from enamel: acid-etching does not enhance the bond strength of composite resins to dentin and may elicit a severe pulpal response. For an effective bond to occur, a dentin bonding system has to be used. The first generation of methacrylate-based dentin adhesives was capable of chemical bonding to the inorganic phase of dentin. The chemical basis for this resin-dentin adhesive was the interaction between a phosphate group attached to the methacrylate and the calcium ions on the dentin surface. This system yielded rather low bond strengths which were clinically unsatisfying. The second generation of dentin adhesives became available to the profession recently. Each of these new bonding systems use similar chemical composition for the same purpose of bonding with physicochemical interaction to the hard tooth tissues. All these systems contain a mild acid dentin conditioner to remove the smear layer and an aqueous resin containing primer to improve monomer penetration into the hydrophilic dentin surface. The second generation dentin bonding systems are extremely sensitive to variations upon the completeness of instructions and how accurately these are followed by dental practitioners.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.2102,A three-generational study of<i>In ovo</i>exposure to PBDE-99 in the zebra finch,"Based on a literature review of avian data for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), ecologically relevant doses, low (10 ng/egg), medium (100 ng/egg), and high (1,000 ng/egg) of the 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) congener along with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) control were injected into the yolk sac of un-incubated eggs of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Offspring development and adult phenotype were followed over three generations. No effects of in ovo PBDE exposure on hatching success, chick growth, thyroid hormone levels, or hematological traits were measured at sexual maturity (90 d posthatching). However, the authors did detect significant effects of BDE-99 treatment on adult phenotype of in ovo-exposed birds by breeding observations, in which clutch size was significantly smaller in all PBDE-dosed birds (low, medium, and high) compared with controls. A trend was also seen for longer laying intervals in PBDE-dosed birds (13-14 d) compared with control birds (8 d). In addition, a significant effect of PBDE was found on growth of the second-generation offspring of in ovo-treated females; body mass was significantly lower in the high-PBDE dosed birds compared with controls from hatch through to fledging (day 30). The authors found no evidence of effects over the longer term and in successive generations, whether in adult, reproductive phenotype of the second-generation offspring of in ovo-treated birds, or in the growth of their (third-generation) offspring. Their results suggest that egg levels as low as 10 ng/g BDE-99 may affect reproduction in small passerines by reducing clutch size.",1
https://doi.org/10.1603/en09153,"Phenology and Abundance of Bean Leaf Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Eastern South Dakota on Alfalfa and Soybean Relative to Tillage, Fertilization, and Yield","Phenology and abundance of bean leaf beetles, Cerotoma trifurcata (Förster), were examined throughout two eastern South Dakota growing seasons in relation to grain yields in chisel- and ridge-tilled soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] grown in 2-yr rotation with corn (Zea mays L.) with and without added nitrogen (N). Populations were also sampled early and late season in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Beetles were present in alfalfa by late May and most were reproductively active within a week, but their presence in alfalfa did not always precede soybean emergence. Most beetles taken from alfalfa in late fall were teneral; all were previtellogenic and unmated. Reproductively active beetles were detected in soybeans as soon as seedlings emerged. A partial second generation apparently occurred each year. First-generation beetles started to emerge in soybean fields during the first or third week of July but, whether emergence started early or late, most beetles emerging after July seemingly failed to mature their eggs and started leaving soybeans within several weeks of eclosion. This pattern suggested that any second generation arose from only the earliest emerging beetles of the first generation, with later emerging individuals having to overwinter before reproducing. Thus, any factors delaying emergence of the first generation, such as delayed soybean planting, could potentially limit its reproductive capacity through winter mortality. Cumulative seasonal beetle counts were lower in N-treated subplots and in ridge-tilled compared with chisel-tilled plots. Soybean grain yield increased with decreases in peak abundance of first-generation beetles and with N fertilization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.02059-06,Telomere Rapid Deletion Regulates Telomere Length in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Telomere length is maintained in species-specific equilibrium primarily through a competition between telomerase-mediated elongation and the loss of terminal DNA through the end-replication problem. Recombinational activities are also capable of both lengthening and shortening telomeres. Here we demonstrate that elongated telomeres in Arabidopsis Ku70 mutants reach a new length set point after three generations. Restoration of wild-type Ku70 in these mutants leads to discrete telomere-shortening events consistent with telomere rapid deletion (TRD). These findings imply that the longer telomere length set point is achieved through competition between overactive telomerase and TRD. Surprisingly, in the absence of telomerase, a subset of elongated telomeres was further lengthened, suggesting that in this background a mechanism of telomerase-independent lengthening of telomeres operates. Unexpectedly, we also found that plants possessing wild-type-length telomeres exhibit TRD when telomerase is inactivated. TRD is stochastic, and all chromosome ends appear to be equally susceptible. The frequency of TRD decreases as telomeres shorten; telomeres less than 2 kb in length are rarely subject to TRD.

A previous analysis of SNF(1) x NZB backcross mice revealed the existence of 4 SWR loci (H2 on chromosome 17, Swrl-1 on chromosome 1, Swrl-2 on chromosome 14, and Swrl-3 on chromosome 18) and 2 NZB loci (Nba1 and Lbw2/Sbw2, both on chromosome 4). A second study focusing on SNF(1) x SWR backcross offspring uncovered 5 suggestive loci for antinuclear antibody formation, consisting of 3 dominant NZB contributions (Nba4 on chromosome 5, Lbw4 on chromosome 6, and Nba5 on chromosome 7) and 2 recessive SWR contributions (Swrl-1 on chromosome 1 and Swrl-4 on chromosome 10). The present intercross study was executed to replicate the earlier findings, using an independent panel of (SWR x NZB)F(2) offspring.A panel of (NZB x SWR)F(2) hybrids were phenotyped (for renal disease, early mortality, and a variety of autoantibodies) and genotyped (using 95 microsatellite primers positioned across all 19 autosomes and the X chromosome). Linkage analysis was conducted using the derived phenotype and genotype data, with the interval-mapping program MapManager.Four suggestive loci were mapped: Swrl-5 on chromosome 1 (peak at 106 cM), linked to hypergammaglobulinemia; an NZB locus on chromosome 5 (Nba4; peak at 15 cM), linked to IgG anti-single-stranded DNA (anti-ssDNA) antibodies, IgG anti-doubled-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, and glomerulonephritis; an NZB locus on chromosome 13 (Nba6; peak at 28 cM), linked to IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies; and an SWR locus on chromosome 14 (Swrl-2; peak at 30 cM), linked to IgG anti-ssDNA antibodies. Eight additional loci revealed linkage at P < 0.01, of which 7 co-mapped with lupus susceptibility loci previously identified in other models.Considering all 3 mapping studies together, lupus in SWR/NZB hybrids appears to be the epistatic end product of several distinct loci, of which 3 SWR-derived loci (Swrl-1, Swrl-2, and Swrl-3) and 5 NZB-derived loci (Nba1, Nba3, Nba4, Nba5, and Lbw4) have been independently confirmed. The immunologic functions and molecular identities of these loci await elucidation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00104-005-1043-9,Chirurgische Therapie von Infektionen der Hand,"Due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. Most of these infections are post-traumatic. Isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci. We find Pasteurella canis and P. multocida from cat and dog bite wounds and Eikenella corrodens from human bite wounds. The ""fight-bite clenched fist"" wound, with penetration of the metacarpophalangeal joint and its high risk of septic arthritis, has always to be suspected when patients present with human bites. The therapy of hand infection is based on three principles: surgical treatment, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiotherapy. Early infectious conditions of the hand, e.g. cellulitis and early paronychia, may be treated without surgery. Antimicrobial treatment must be specific for the pathogen and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. Bite wounds should be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. Staphylococci and streptococci can be covered by first and second generation cephalosporins. The increasing resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics has to be taken into account. Infections with anaerobic and gas-producing bacteria are rare but occur predominantly in diabetics and immune-compromised individuals.",0

We reviewed a population of 155 HD-families to determine the frequency, molecular and clinical characteristics of children with an onset before the age of 10 years. In each case, a neurological evaluation was performed as well as molecular detection of the expanded CAG triplet in the affected child and both parents. The family history was also reviewed and updated. Seven children (1.92%) had onset of symptoms before the age of 10, two of them were dead by the time of the study. Large CAG expansions with intergenerational instability were identified, and in one case the child's allele was almost three times larger than the allele of the asymptomatic transmitting father, a situation reported only once before. Clinically, they showed preponderance of rigidity, seizures, learning disabilities and a rapid course of the disease. We attempted to use UHDRS. However, consistent results could not be obtained, suggesting that the scale should be revised for use in juvenile cases. HD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in children, even in the absence of a positive family history.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/030144699282994,Genetics of human body size and shape: evidence for an oligogenic control of adiposity,"In a previous study by the authors in each of the pedigree samples from Kirghizstan, Turkmenia and Chuvashia, four principal factors supposedly controlled by four non-overlapping gene subsets were found. About 90% of total variation of adiposity as assessed by 22 measurements of skinfolds, circumferences and indices were covered by these factors. This study provides results of segregation analysis of each of these four factors. By the usual transmission probability tests, major gene (MG) control was accepted in all 12 analyses--four traits in three populations. Some of the most parsimonious MG models included non-MG effects, such as correlation of residuals between spouses, between parent and offspring and between sibs. The Kirghizian samples showed a significant assortative mating effect as measured by the correlation between genotypic values at putative MG in spouses. The proportion of the trait variance attributable to the MG effect varied from 0.296 (factor F4 in the Chuvashia sample) to 0.596 (the same factor in the Kirghizian sample). It is assumed that four independent large-effect genes can be recognized in the genetic control of adiposity determining, respectively, individual predisposition to accumulate subcutaneous fat, its distribution between the body trunk and extremities, predisposition to accumulate inner fat and its distribution between the upper and lower body parts. In each population, unification of the four most parsimonious MG models forms oligogenic models explaining from 0.364 (Chuvashia) to 0.540 (Kirghizstan) of total adiposity.",0

It is tempting to speculate that glimepiride would improve bone-implant contact in diabetic patients by mediating the activity of GLUT1 and 3 via the PI3K/Akt pathway. In this study, we investigated the effects of glimepiride on rat mandible osteoblasts cultured under two different levels of glucose. Cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay. The supernatant was used to measure alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Glucose uptake was determined by measuring the rate of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) uptake. Western blotting was performed used to determine collagen I and PI3K/Akt expression. RT-PCR was performed used to determine osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA expression. We found that hyperglycemia down-regulated proliferation, ALP activity, OCN mRNA and GLUT3 protein expression in rat osteoblasts, and upregulated collagen I and GLUT1 protein expressions. Glimepiride enhanced the proliferation, ALP activity and OCN mRNA levels, and upregulated collagen I and GLUT1 and 3 protein expressions of rat osteoblasts at two different glucose concentrations. This study also provides the first evidence that glimepiride stimulates the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt in osteoblasts and ameliorated the damage caused by high concentrations of glucose through the PI3K/Akt pathway.",0

The clinical manifestations of the disease are described, and a genetic analysis is presented. Genealogic studies have shown that the autosomal mutant gene for lipoid proteinosis was introduced into South Africa by a German settler and his sister in the mid-17th century. A great-grandson of that settler carried the gene to Namaqualand, where several generations of inbreeding have produced numerous affected homozygotes.",0

Herein, our objectives were to develop models to simulate uterine vascular impedance in order to gain insight into the vascular size and stiffness changes that occur during ovarian cycling and pregnancy.Two electrical analogue transmission line models were developed and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit to experimental impedance measurements, which were obtained in nonpregnant luteal and follicular phase (NP-L and NP-F) and pregnant (P) ewes (n=4-8 per group). First, an anatomically based, multi-segment, symmetric, branching transmission line model was developed. Parameter values were calculated based on experimental measurements of size and stiffness in the first three generations of the uterine arterial tree for NP-L, NP-F and P ewes. Then, a single segment transmission line model was developed and effective parameter values were optimized to best-fit the measured impedances.The anatomically based multi-segment model did not yield the expected good agreement with the experimental data (R(2)<0.5 for all groups). In contrast, the impedance spectra predicted by the single segment model agreed very well with experimental data (R(2)=0.93, 0.82, and 0.84 for NP-L, NP-F and P, respectively; p<0.0001, all groups). Furthermore, the changes in the best-fit model parameters for NP-F and P compared to the NP-L were consistent with the prior literature on the effects of the ovarian cycle and pregnancy on vascular resistance and compliance. In particular, compared to NP-L, NP-F had decreased longitudinal and terminal resistance with a modest increase in compliance whereas pregnancy caused more dramatic drops in longitudinal and terminal resistance and a significant increase in compliance.The single segment transmission line model is a useful tool to examine changes in vascular structure and function that occur during the ovarian cycle and pregnancy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.289.6458.1561,Recurrent pyoderma in a family with a defect in leucocyte locomotion.,"Granulocyte functions including leucocyte locomotion and chemoluminescence were studied in three generations of a family in which all male members had presented with recurrent pyoderma. While parameters of humoral immunity including serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE and of complement components C3 and C4 as well as the response of mononuclear leucocytes to mitogens proved to be within the normal range, leucocyte locomotion was found to be severely impaired in all affected subjects. Moreover, granulocyte dysfunction in male members was associated with the occurrence of a single haplotype (HLA-A2, B13, DR7). These findings suggest that the defect in leucocyte locomotion and the pyoderma might not only have been inherited in an X linked manner but might also have been linked to a gene within the inherited HLA haplotype.",0

All of these enzymes are synthesized constitutively, demonstrate efficient hydrolysis of penicillins, are highly susceptible to the action of clavulanic acid and sulbactam, and have no detectable activity against the cephamycins and imipenem. With the methoxyimino cephalosporins, including those of the third generation, the rates of hydrolysis observed for the SHV-2, CTX-1, and CAZ-1 enzymes are high and show no relation to those observed for the other presently known beta-lactamases. Structure-activity relations suggest that the oxime substituent of these cephalosporins is a major structural factor in the catalytic process observed with the three new beta-lactamases.",0
https://doi.org/10.1086/302713,The Locus of a Novel Gene Responsible for Arrhythmogenic Right-Ventricular Dysplasia Characterized by Early Onset and High Penetrance Maps to Chromosome 10p12-p14,"Arrhythmogenic right-ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), a cardiomyopathy inherited as an autosomal-dominant disease, is characterized by fibro-fatty infiltration of the right-ventricular myocardium. Four loci for ARVD have been mapped in the Italian population, and recently the first locus was mapped in inhabitants of North America. None of the genes have been identified. We have now identified another North American family with early onset of ARVD and high penetrance. All of the children with the disease haplotype had pathological or clinical evidence of the disease at age <10 years. The family spans five generations, having 10 living and 2 dead affected individuals, with ARVD segregating as an autosomal-dominant disorder. Genetic linkage analysis excluded known loci, and a novel locus was identified on chromosome 10p12-p14. A peak two-point LOD score of 3.92 was obtained with marker D10S1664, at a recombination fraction of 0. Additional genotyping and haplotype analysis identified a shared region of 10.6 cM between marker D10S547 and D10S1653. Thus, a novel gene responsible for ARVD resides on the short arm of chromosome 10. This disease is intriguing, since it initiates exclusively in the right ventricle and exhibits pathological features of apoptosis. Chromosomal localization of the ARVD gene is the first step in identification of the genetic defect and the unraveling of the molecular basis responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease.",0

,Familial complex chromosomal rearrangement in a dysmorphic child with global developmental delay.,"We report the unusual case of a dysmorphic child with global developmental delay secondary to a familial complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR). His chromosomal analysis using G-banding and dual colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation with whole chromosome paint revealed a supernumerary marker chromosome as a result of malsegregation of a familial CCR involving chromosomes 7, 12 and 14. The balanced form of this familial CCR was also carried by the patient's mother and maternal grandmother, both of whom had a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions, as well as his maternal uncle, who was infertile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of familial CCR involving chromosomes 7, 12 and 14. This case also highlights the importance of chromosomal analysis in children with dysmorphism and developmental delay as well as in adults who suffer from recurrent spontaneous abortions or infertility.",0

In cemented hip arthroplasty, failure of the acetabular side is mainly due to lysis caused by wear particles. By using an implant with low wear characteristics and by enhancing acetabular fixation using an uncemented implant, we aimed to reduce acetabular lysis and thereby loosening.This was a retrospective cohort study of 119 hips (101 patients) that had the Uncemented Fitmore cup (Sulzer Orthopedics). In 66 patients, the femoral component was CF-30 (Sulzer) used with cement. In the remaining 35 patients, thrust plate prosthesis (TPP) (Sulzer) was used. Of the 101 patients, 94 (112 hips) were available for study. Mean follow-up of the 94 patients was 7 (5-13) years.The mean preoperative Harris hip score was 38 and the mean postoperative Harris hip score was 89 at the last follow-up. Taking aseptic loosening as the endpoint, the survival rate of the Fitmore cup was 100% at 11 years.The uncemented Fitmore acetabular cup with second generation metal-on-metal articulation showed good results with regard to aseptic loosening in the medium term.",0

Six F1 boars were mated to 73 F1 sows. The F2 progeny from 33 full-sib families (250 individuals) were genotyped for seven microsatellites spanning the length of chromosome 4. Least squares procedures for interval mapping were used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). A permutation test was used to establish nominal significance levels associated with QTL effects, and resulting probability levels were corrected to a genomewide basis. Observed QTL effects were (genomewide significance, position of maximum significance in centimorgans): percentage of linoleic acid in subcutaneous adipose tissue (< 0.01, 81); backfat thickness (< 0.01, 83); backfat weight (< 0.01, 80); longissimus muscle area (0.02, 83); live weight (0.19, 88); and percentage of oleic acid in subcutaneous adipose tissue (0.25, 81). Gene action was primarily additive. The Iberian genotypes were fatter, slower growing, and had lower linoleic and higher oleic acid contents than Landrace genotypes. The interval from 80 to 83 cM contains the FAT1 and A-FABP loci that have been shown previously to affect fat deposition in pigs. This is the first report of a QTL affecting fatty acid composition of subcutaneous adipose tissue in pigs and provides a guide for the metabolic pathways affected by candidate genes described in this region of chromosome 4.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s002840010255,Disruption of a Global Regulatory Gene to Enhance Central Carbon Flux into Phenylalanine Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli,"Genetic engineering of microbes for commercial metabolite production traditionally has sought to alter the levels and/or intrinsic activities of key enzymes in relevant biosynthetic pathway(s). Microorganisms exploit similar strategies for flux control, but also coordinate flux through sets of related pathways by using global regulatory circuits. We have engineered a global regulatory system of Escherichia coli, Csr (carbon storage regulator), to increase precursor for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Disruption of csrA increases gluconeogenesis, decreases glycolysis, and thus elevates phosphoenolpyruvate, a limiting precursor of aromatics. A strain in which the aromatic (shikimate) pathway had been optimized produced twofold more phenylalanine when csrA was disrupted. Overexpression of tktA (transketolase) to increase the other precursor, erythrose-4-phosphate, yielded ∼1.4-fold enhancement, while both changes were additive. These effects of csrA were not mediated by increasing the regulatory enzymes of phenylalanine biosynthesis. This study introduces the concept of “global metabolic engineering” for second-generation strain improvement.",0
https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.6.2.201,"ENOD12, an early nodulin gene, is not required for nodule formation and efficient nitrogen fixation in alfalfa.","To demonstrate the importance of an extensively studied early nodulin gene ENOD12 in symbiotic nodule development, plants of different Medicago sativa subspecies were tested for the presence or absence of ENOD12 alleles. In M. s. ssp coerulea w2 (Mcw2), two ENOD12 genes were detected, whereas in M. s. ssp quasifalcata k93 (Mqk93) only one gene was present. In both plants, the ENOD12 genes were expressed in nodules induced by Rhizobium meliloti. The nucleotide sequence of the ENOD12 genes showed that the two Mcw2-specific genes were similar to the ENOD12A and ENOD12B genes of the tetraploid M. s. ssp sativa. ENOD12 from Mqk93 was similar to the corresponding gene found in M. truncatula. From the aligned ENOD12 sequences, an evolutionary tree was constructed. Genetic analysis of the progenies of a cross between Mqk93 and Mcw2 showed that several offspring in F1 carried a null allele originating from Mcw2, and among the F2 progenies, plants with the null allele only lacking the ENOD12 gene appeared. Surprisingly, the ENOD12-deficient plants were similar to their wild-type parents in viability, nodule development, nodule structure, and nitrogen fixation efficiency. Therefore, we concluded that in Medicago the ENOD12 gene is not required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, we proposed that the heterozygous nature of these legumes can be exploited for the identification of mutated alleles of other known nodulin genes; this will permit the construction of plant mutants deficient in these genes.",0

Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in the risks of the composite of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (cardiac death/MI), cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, however, DES was associated with significant reduction in the risk of target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared with BMS [0.48 (0.33, 0.70)] with consistent benefits among patients with reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.5 mm, reference vessel diameter ≥ 4.0 mm, stent length ≤ 15 mm, first-generation DES or second-generation DES. In patients with ≥ 3-year follow-up, there were no significant between-group differences in the risk of cardiac death/MI, TVR, cardiac death, myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis.This meta-analysis suggests that DES is superior to BMS in terms of adverse cardiac events in large coronary arteries at the mid-term follow-up. The long-term efficacy of newer-generation DES versus BMS in larger coronary arteries is still worth further evaluation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpg.2006.07.004,Prevention and treatment of infections in patients with cirrhosis,"Patients with cirrhosis have altered immune defenses and are considered immunocompromised individuals. Changes in gut motility, mucosal defense and microflora allow for translocation of enteric bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes and the blood stream. Additionally, the cirrhotic liver is ineffective at clearing bacteria and associated endotoxins from the blood thus allowing for seeding of the sterile peritoneal fluid. Thus, hospitalised cirrhotic patients, particularly those with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, are at high risk of developing bacterial infections, the most common being spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and the fact that half of the cases are community acquired, all hospitalised cirrhotic patients should have a diagnostic paracentesis to exclude infection. Those admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and a negative paracentesis require short-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin. A third generation cephalosporin is the treatment of choice for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and, once the acute infection is resolved, secondary prophylaxis with oral norfloxacin is warranted. Patients who develop renal dysfunction at the time of active infection have the highest mortality and require adjunctive albumin therapy. This article reviews the pathogenesis of SBP, the evidence behind the antibiotics used, the rationale for adjunctive albumin therapy in the setting of acute renal failure, and the role of prophylactic antibiotics in specific high-risk populations.",0

https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.036822,Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis of Growth-Related Traits in a New Arabidopsis Recombinant Inbred Population,"Abstract Arabidopsis natural variation was used to analyze the genetics of plant growth rate. Screening of 22 accessions revealed a large variation for seed weight, plant dry weight and relative growth rate but not for water content. A positive correlation was observed between seed weight and plant area 10 d after planting, suggesting that seed weight affects plant growth during early phases of development. During later stages of plant growth this correlation was not significant, indicating that other factors determine growth rate during this phase. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, using 114 (F9 generation) recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between Landsberg erecta (Ler, from Poland) and Shakdara (Sha, from Tadjikistan), revealed QTLs for seed weight, plant area, dry weight, relative growth rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, flowering time, and flowering-related traits. Growth traits (plant area, dry weight, and relative growth rate) colocated at five genomic regions. At the bottom of chromosome 5, colocation was found of QTLs for leaf area, leaf initiation speed, specific leaf area, and chlorophyll fluorescence but not for dry weight, indicating that this locus might be involved in leaf development. No consistent relation between growth traits and flowering time was observed despite some colocations. Some of the QTLs detected for flowering time overlapped with loci detected in other recombinant inbred line populations, but also new loci were identified. This study shows that Arabidopsis can successfully be used to study the genetic basis of complex traits like plant growth rate.",0

Two tasks examined children and adolescents' (4, 7, 10, and 14 years) conceptions of phenotypic resemblance across kin (in physical characteristics, disabilities, and personality traits). The first task required participants to predict and explain feature outcomes in both an offspring and a sibling, in a modified version of the phenotypic similarity task. In the second task, participants offered explanations for instances of parent-offspring dissimilarity and grandparent-offspring resemblance (phenotypic difference task). The inclusion of two tasks and a broad age range revealed significant age trends between 4 and 10 years in naïve inheritance concepts. However, there was little consistency in children's inheritance explanations within or across tasks. The findings are discussed with reference to debates concerning the development and structure of naïve biology concepts.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2009.297,Targeted Cancer Therapies in the Twenty-First Century: Lessons From Imatinib,"An increased understanding of the molecular etiology of cancer has enabled the development of novel therapies that are collectively referred to as molecular targeted agents. Unlike the drugs used in conventional chemotherapy, these agents are designed to specifically interfere with key molecular events that are responsible for the malignant phenotype. They hold great promise for widening the therapeutic window, which would provide more effective treatment options as compared with cytotoxic therapies. In addition, the targeted approach that is characteristic of these drugs provides unique opportunities for combination therapies with other anticancer agents that have non-overlapping toxicities. Targeted agents are therefore primed to become invaluable therapeutic tools in the multimodal treatment of cancer. The challenges associated with these novel targeted therapies are distinct from those faced in conventional chemotherapy. These unique challenges include the need to select appropriate pharmacodynamic markers to guide dose and schedule and to identify biomarkers that enable selection of patient populations that are most likely to benefit from the treatment. In addition, although the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies is a problem frequently faced in the clinic, the molecular characterization of resistance mechanisms provides the opportunity to design second-generation therapies or combination therapies aimed at preventing resistance or restoring response. The development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the application of imatinib and other targeted agents in clinical practice and discuss how these insights may guide the development of novel targeted therapies.",0

Commentators frequently contradicted themselves, as well as each other. The popularity of Christian fundamentalism waned following the World Wars. Eventually the rug was pulled from beneath it – till a more recent reaction. Amidst all this babble coming from numerous towers of Babel over centuries, we failed to see Charles Darwin as the great environmentalist: who said environmental conditions, whilst working hand in glove with natural selection, constituted the more important 'law.' A bird's eye view of 18th and 19th century evolutionary thought is considered against the climate of those times (politics, industrial revolution, trade, religious expansionism, etc). Darwinism superseded Lamarckism helped by the neo-Darwinism of Weismann, higher mathematics, population genetics – the 'Modern Synthesis' of 1935 – culminating in the discovery of the double helix by Watson, Crick et al, assuring us of the correctness of 'primacy of DNA theory'. Stimulation and challenge is currently fuelled by exciting nascent knowledge of epigenetic variations and Cairnsian 'adaptive mutations'.

Based on densitometric scanning of films, four indexes addressed to different features of the PCR pattern were used to quantitate mosaicism. These revealed strong correlations with CAG size and intergenerational instability. However, mosaicism did not show a greater similarity in sibs who shared the same HD chromosome, nor was correlated with instability in the proband's pedigree. Our data do not support the hypothesis that cis-acting factors play a major role in the instability and leave the CAG size per se as the major determinant of sperm cell CAG instability.",0

MECP2 mutations, once thought to be lethal in males, now present a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations in males. This article reports a family with a 9-year-old boy with Rett-like phenotype and congenital blindness, who inherited a novel MECP2 variant (p.P430S) from his asymptomatic mother. The variant was also identified in the asymptomatic maternal grandfather and maternal aunts of the proband, ruling out the possibility that the p.P430S was involved in the phenotype. Findings of the study suggest that a careful evaluation of the pathogenic nature of MECP2 variants identified in males be conducted before proposing genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis to the family and that the interference of other factors like modifier genes, environment, epigenetics, and mosaicism be taken into account.",0

https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.85.6.702,Pseudoexfoliation syndrome in Icelandic families,"To examine the distribution and clinical ophthalmic characteristics of pseudoexfoliation syndrome (pseudoexfoliation) and glaucoma in Icelandic families.Icelandic families containing three or more members aged 70 or older with at least one member with pseudoexfoliation were identified. All family members over age 45 were invited to participate. Visual acuity, Goldmann applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, slit lamp examination before and after dilatation, and dilated fundus examination were performed on all available family members. Pertinent data were obtained from medical records, including ophthalmic history and a medical history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, systemic hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Participants were classified according to affected status for pseudoexfoliation, glaucoma, and age related macular degeneration.Six families were identified who met the criteria for entry into the study. Of 94 family members who were invited to participate 82 were enrolled (87%). Of these 25 (30%) had pseudoexfoliation syndrome, 51 (62%) were unaffected, and six (7%) were suspects. At least one individual with pseudoexfoliation was identified in the second generation of every family. A parent with pseudoexfoliation was identified in all cases either by examination (4/6) or a review of ophthalmic records (2/6). In all cases the mother was the affected parent. The prevalence of glaucoma was significantly greater in the group with pseudoexfoliation (p <0.0001). Although the presence of age related macular degeneration (ARMD) was highly associated with the presence of pseudoexfoliation, the significance was lost after correction for age (p = 0.69). Although the sample size was small, no association between pseudoexfoliation affected status and cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, systemic hypertension, or diabetes mellitus was found.Multiple Icelandic families with pseudoexfoliation in two generations were identified. In all cases where determination was possible, transmission to the second generation was through an affected parent. In each case the affected parent was the mother. Pseudoexfoliation was strongly associated with the presence of glaucoma, but was not associated with either ARMD or systemic disease in this study. These data clearly indicate that pseudoexfoliation is a familial condition and although not conclusive, supports the hypothesis that pseudoexfoliation syndrome is genetically inherited.",0

,Changes in mammalian sperm morphology after X-ray and chemical exposures.,"Sperm head morphology in mammals provides a unique approach to quantiating the effects of environmental agents on the germ cells. In unperturbed male mice, the sperm of each genotype can be reproducibly characterized by the shape of the head, the overall percent of sperm with head-shape abnormalities and the types of shape abnormalities seen. Genetic studies show that sperm shape is highly heritable, and that the fraction of abnormal sperm is controlled by a multitude of autosomal factors plus probably involvement of the sex chromosomes.--Exposure to ionizing radiation or certain chemical agents in vivo leads to dosage-dependent increase in the fraction of sperm with head-shape abnormalities. These results are documented in numerous mammalian species, including man. Evidence from mouse studies suggests that in general sperm shape is affected by those agents considered to be mutagenic. Since sperm samples are easily obtained and sperm morphology is rapidly quantitated, these observations suggest that sperm morphology in the mouse may be an applicable screen for environmental effects on germ cells. Changes in sperm are also seen in the offspring of male mice exposed to irradiation or a chemical alkylating agent. Preliminary evidence suggests that these changes represent heritable sperm shape abnormalities that can be further transmitted to subsequent generations.--The problems of determining the genetic implications of induced sperm abnormalities in exposed males are discussed. It is suggested that sperm morphology testing may have a direct application in man.",1

Rates of clinical failure and mortality are higher than those in studies with non-ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, in settings with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, empirical therapy with advanced cephalosporins should be avoided. Temocillin, an old beta-lactam that is stable in the presence of both ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases, seems to deserve revival, although clinical data are limited.",0
,[Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). I. Susceptibility distribution].,"The results of determinations of sensitivities of bacterial strains to various antibiotics are summarized as follows: 1. Against Escherichia coli, ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the strongest activity among oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents. Its MIC90 was below 0.10 micrograms/ml. The next strongest activity was found in mecillinam (MPC), cefaclor (CCL) and pipemidic acid (PPA); MIC90's of these agents 3.13 micrograms/ml. Cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) had MIC90 below 0.39 micrograms/ml. MIC90's of cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 1.56 micrograms/ml. Aztreonam (AZT) and carumonam (CRMN) in the monobactam group showed strong activities with MIC90's at 0.20 micrograms/ml. 2. Although Klebsiella pneumoniae had a strong resistance to ampicillin (ABPC) and showed relatively low sensitivities to other oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents, OFLX maintained high activity against this species and showed MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. Among injectable antibiotics, third generation cephems showed the strongest activity to this species with MIC90 of CZX below 0.10 micrograms/ml, of CTX and CMX 0.20 micrograms/ml, and of LMOX 0.78 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was the same as those of cefazolin (CEZ) and cefoxitin (CFX). CTM had similar MIC90 to LMOX, namely, 1.56 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CMZ was 3.13 micrograms/ml. Monobactams AZT and CRMN showed strong activities to this species; their MIC90's were below 0.10 micrograms/ml and 0.20 micrograms/ml. 3. Although Citrobacter freundii generally exhibited low sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents examined, it showed high sensitivity to OFLX, at MIC80 of 0.78 micrograms/ml. This species showed low sensitivities to MPC, nalidixic acid (NA), PPA, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST). Among injectable antibiotics, LMOX and CMX had activities against this species; namely, MIC80's were 6.25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among monobactams, AZT showed MIC80 of 12.5 micrograms/ml, and CRMN had that of 6.25 micrograms/ml. 4. Against Enterobacter cloacae, the strongest antibacterial activity was found with OFLX which had MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. A relatively strong activity was seen with MPC. MIC80 of MPC was 1.56 micrograms/ml. Except to CTM, this species had poor sensitivities to injectable first and second generation cephems, and their MIC80's were over 200 micrograms/ml. MIC80 of CTM was 25 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0

While new support for nuclear power can be found in arguments concerning greenhouse gases and global warming, the long-term existence of radioactive waste has led to requirements for 10,000-year isolation. Some of the support for such requirements is based on intergenerational equity arguments. This, however, places a very high value on lives far in the future. An alternative is to use discounting, as is applied to other resource applications. Nuclear weapons, even though being dismantled by the major nations, are growing in number due to the increase in the number of countries possessing these weapons of mass destruction. This is an unfortunate legacy for future generations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2012.06.016,Negative correlation between cerebrospinal fluid oxytocin levels and negative symptoms of male patients with schizophrenia,"Accumulating evidence indicates that oxytocin plays an important role in social interactions. Previous studies also suggest altered oxytocin function in patients with schizophrenia and depression. However, few studies have examined the central oxytocin levels in these disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oxytocin levels were measured by ELISA in male participants consisting of 27 patients with schizophrenia, 17 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 21 healthy controls. CSF oxytocin levels of patients with schizophrenia or MDD did not differ significantly with healthy controls. The antidepressant dose or the Hamilton depression rating scale score did not significantly correlate with the oxytocin levels in MDD patients. CSF oxytocin levels in schizophrenic patients significantly negatively correlated with second generation antipsychotic dose ( r = − 0.49, P = 0.010) but not with first generation antipsychotic dose ( r = − 0.13, P = 0.50). A significant correlation was observed between oxytocin levels and negative subscale of PANSS ( r = − 0.38, P = 0.050). This correlation remained significant even after controlling for second generation antipsychotic dose ( r = − 0.47, P = 0.016). We obtained no evidence of altered CSF oxytocin levels in patients with schizophrenia or those with MDD. However, lower oxytocin levels may be related to higher second generation antipsychotic dose and more severe negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-009-0006-0,Metabolic risks in older adults receiving second-generation antipsychotic medication,"Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in older adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Second-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone) increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and present many challenges for psychiatrists. In this article, we review the relationships between second-generation antipsychotics and metabolic syndrome with a focus on older adults. Because few studies focus exclusively on older adults, we augment this review with relevant findings from younger adults. The differential risk factors of each medication are reviewed, as are recent findings in monitoring and treating metabolic syndrome. Olanzapine and clozapine are more strongly associated with metabolic risks, whereas aripiprazole and ziprasidone are less associated. Although lifestyle modifications can help to reduce some aspects of metabolic syndrome, lifestyle modifications in conjunction with metformin therapy appear to be most effective.",0

Control animals constituted the parental generation (P). The undernourished generations (F1 and F2) were fed 75% of the control diet. Animals were X-rayed every 10 days from 20 to 100 days of age. The length, width and height of the major (neurocranium and splanchnocranium) and minor (anterior-neural, middle-neural, posterior-neural, otic, respiratory, masticatory and alveolar) cranial components were measured on each radiograph. Volumetric indices were calculated to estimate size variations of these components. Data were processed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for two samples. Impairment in splanchnocranial and neurocranial growth was found, the latter being more affected than the former in F1. Comparison between F2 and F1 animals showed cumulative effects of undernutrition in both major and minor components (anterior-neural, respiratory, masticatory and alveolar in males, and middle-neural and respiratory in females). Such differential effects on minor components may reflect a residual mechanical strain resulting from the linkage between components. This phenomenon was clearly observed in the neurocranium and could be understood as an adaptive response to the demands of the associated functional matrices.",0
,The epidemiology of prostate cancer part II: the risk factors.,"The epidemiology of prostate cancer gives us some clues that its etiology is likely both environmental and genetic. There is extreme country to country variability in prostate cancer mortality. Countries in which dietary fat intake is greater have been shown to have higher prostate cancer mortality rates leaving some to conclude that dietary fat causes prostate cancer. Migration studies show that men moving from Japan and China adopt increased risks of prostate cancer. Second- and third-generation Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans actually have risks of prostate cancer similar to white American men. This is highly suggestive that prostate cancer has an environmental influence. The differences in black-white mortality and newer data suggesting a higher mortality among Jamaican and Brazilian men of African descent suggest there may be a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. Some have suggested certain polymorphisms increase prostate cancer risk, whereas others are searching for genetic mutations that may increase prostate cancer risk. Africans may have an increased prevalence of these genetic risk factors. Ultimately, the cause of prostate cancer is likely to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors.",1

https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-4731(90)90189-y,Differential effects of calcium on progesterone production in small and large bovine luteal cells,"We studied the effects of calcium (Ca2+) ions in progesterone (P) production by separated small and large luteal cells. Corpora lutea were collected from 31 heifers between days 10 and 12 of the estrous cycle. Purified small and large cells were obtained by unit gravity sedimentation and flow cytometry. P accumulation in cells plus media was determined after incubating 1 x 10(5) small and 5 x 10(3) large cells for 2 and 4 h respectively. Removal of Ca2+ from the medium did not influence basal P production in the small cells (P greater than 0.05). However, stimulation of P by luteinizing hormone (LH), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 8-bromo-cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) was impaired (P less than 0.05) by low Ca2+ concentrations. LH and PGE2-stimulated cAMP production was not altered by low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and PGF2 alpha had no effect on cAMP. In contrast, basal as well as LH and forskolin-stimulated P production were attenuated (P less than 0.05) in Ca2(+)-deficient medium in the large cells. However, P production stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP was not altered in Ca2(+)-deficient medium. Steroidogenesis in large cells was also dependent on intracellular Ca2+, since 8-N, N-diethylamineocytyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release and/or action, suppressed (P less than 0.05) basal, LH and 8-Br-cAMP stimulated P. In contrast, basal P in small cells was not altered by TMB-8; whereas LH-stimulated P was reduced 2-fold (P less than 0.05). The calcium ionophore, A23187, inhibited LH-stimulated P in small cells and both basal and agonist-stimulated P in large cells. These studies show that basal P production in small cells does not require Ca2+ ions, while hormone-stimulated P production in small cells and both basal and hormone-stimulated P in large cells do require Ca2+. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ ion removal was exerted prior to the generation of cAMP in the large cells, but distal to cAMP generation in hormone-stimulated small cells. The calmodulin/protein kinase C antagonist, W-7, also inhibited both basal and hormone-stimulated P production in both small and large luteal cells, indicating that P production in luteal cells also involves Ca2(+)-calmodulin/protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2010.04962.x,Circadian clocks and adaptation in Arabidopsis,"Endogenous circadian rhythms are almost ubiquitous among organisms from cyanobacteria to mammals and regulate diverse physiological processes. It has been suggested that having an endogenous circadian system enables an organism to anticipate periodic environmental changes and adapt its physiological and developmental states accordingly, thus conferring a fitness advantage. However, it is hard to measure fitness directly and there is, to date, only limited evidence supporting the assumption that having a circadian system can increase fitness and therefore be adaptive. In this article, we report an evolutionary approach to examine the adaptive significance of a circadian system. By crossing Arabidopsis thaliana plants containing mutations that cause changes in circadian rhythms, we have created heterozygous 'Mother' (F1) plants with genetic variance for circadian rhythmicity. The segregating F2 offspring present a range of circadian rhythm periods. We have applied a selection to the F2 plants of short and long T-cycles under different competition strengths and found that the average phenotype of circadian period of the resulting F3 plants show a strong positive correlation with the T-cycle growth conditions for the competing F2 plants. Consistent with their circadian phenotypes, the frequency of long-period alleles was altered in the F3 plants. Our results show that F2 plants with endogenous rhythms that more closely match the environmental T-cycle are fitter, producing relatively more viable offspring in the F3 population. Thus, having a circadian clock that matches with the environment is adaptive in Arabidopsis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.200600777,Redox-Controlled Interaction of Biferrocenyl-Terminated Dendrimers with β-Cyclodextrin Molecular Printboards,"This paper describes the synthesis and electrochemistry of biferrocenyl-terminated dendrimers and their beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) inclusion complexes in aqueous solution and at surfaces. Three generations of poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers, decorated with 4, 8, and 16 biferrocenyl (BFc) units, respectively, were synthesized. A water-soluble BFc derivative forms stable inclusion complexes with beta-CD. The intrinsic binding constant is K(i)=2.5 x 10(4) M(-1). The BFc dendrimers were solubilized in water by complexation of the end groups with beta-CD, resulting in large water-soluble supramolecular assemblies. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) showed that all the end groups are complexed to beta-CD. Adsorption of the dendrimers at self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of heptathioether-functionalized beta-CD on gold (""molecular printboards"") resulted in stable monolayers of the dendrimers due to the formation of multivalent host-guest interactions between the BFc end groups of the dendrimers and the immobilized beta-CD molecules. The number of interacting end groups is 3, 4, and 4 for dendrimer generations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The complexation of BFc to beta-CD is sensitive to the oxidation state of the BFc unit. Oxidation of neutral BFc-Fe(2) ((II,II)) to the cationic, mixed-valence biferrocenium BFc-Fe(2) ((II,III)+) resulted in dissociation of the host-guest complexes. Scan-rate-dependent CV and DPV analyses of the dendrimer-beta-CD assemblies immobilized at the beta-CD host surface and in solution revealed that the dendrimers are oxidized in three steps. First, the surface-beta-CD-bound BFc moieties are oxidized to the mixed-valence state, Fe(2) ((II,III)+), followed by the oxidation of the non-surface-interacting BFc groups to the Fe(2) ((II,III)+) state. The third step involves the oxidation of all the BFc moieties to the Fe(2) ((III,III)2+) state.",0
,[What is the risk of future development of ischemic heart disease in juvenile hypertensives?].,"The investigation was focused on the incidence of some amenable risk factors of ischaemic heart disease in 51 adolescent men aged 15-19 years. The author compares the incidence of these risk factors in normotonics and hypertonics. The investigation revealed that the group of juvenile hypertonic subjects is from the aspect of future development of ischaemic heart disease at greater risk, as compared with the group of normotonic subjects. In families of juvenile hypertonic subjects the disease is more frequent in parents and grandparents and there are more frequent early deaths from this disease in the family. Juvenile hypertonics are more frequently obese and have a more risky level of serum cholesterol, as compared with adolescent normotonic subjects. The task of the general practitioner for children and adolescents is to detect by early screening and to include in dispensary care all subjects at risk and to recommend appropriate provisions to reduce the risk of development of ischaemic heart disease in adult age.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s002440010208,In Ovo Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls: Reproductive Effects on Second-Generation American Kestrels,"The reproductive success of wild birds has been af- fected by exposure to multiple contaminants. Reproduction of captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) was suppressed when adult birds were exposed to dietary polychlorinated biphe- nyls (PCBs). In this study, the reproductive effects of in ovo exposure to PCBs is explored, along with determining effects on reproduction in second-generation birds indirectly exposed to PCBs. Reproductive changes in this subsequent generation are examined separately in male and female birds. Captive American kestrels (F. sparverius) were hatched from clutches with eggs containing environmentally relevant levels of total PCBs (34.0 mg/g whole egg WW versus 0 mg/g controls); parent birds had been fed PCB-spiked (Aroclor 1248:1254:1260) food (7 mg/kg BW day 21 ) for 100 days until their eggs hatched. In 1999, the second-generation PCB birds were paired with unexposed kestrels having reproductive experience. In ovo PCB exposure suppressed egg laying completely in 25% of PCB females and resulted in delays in clutch initiation and smaller clutch sizes for PCB male and female pairs. There was no evidence in this study of in ovo PCB treatment effects on fertility or hatching success. The decline in reproductive success was also reflected in the reduced fledging success and higher incidence of complete brood mortality of PCB nestlings. Differences between in ovo- exposed PCB males and females but not between controls were evident in reproductive success. In ovo PCB exposure appears to have had greater effects on female kestrels until clutch completion, with a greater time lag between pairing and egg laying, reduced numbers of pairs laying eggs, and smaller clutches being laid. In ovo PCB exposure has greater effects later in the breeding season on male kestrels, which had poorer hatching and fledging success relative to the PCB females. Possible behavioral and physiological mechanisms in- volved in these reproductive changes are discussed.",1

This incompatibility acts as postzygotic reproductive isolation, which results in the irreversible divergence of species. Here, we show that the reciprocal loss of duplicated genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 causes hybrid pollen sterility in F 1 hybrids of the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relative O . glumaepatula . Functional analysis revealed that this gene is essential for the later stage of pollen development, and distribution analysis suggests that the gene duplication occurred before the divergence of the AA genome species. On the basis of these results, we discuss the possible contribution of the “founder effect” in establishing this reproductive barrier.",0

This study examines adolescent alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use by generation/time in US (i.e., first generation, in US ≤4 years; first generation, in US >4 years; second generation; and third generation or higher). Data come from a 2008 survey of Boston, Massachusetts public high school students (n = 1485). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between generation/time in the US and risk of past 30-day substance use, adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. To determine whether the associations differed by gender, we fit gender stratified regression models. The prevalence of substance use was lowest among immigrants who had been in the US ≤4 years. Among girls, generation/time in US was not related to alcohol use or to tobacco use. For boys, being an immigrant regardless of number of years in the US, as well as second generation was associated with a significantly lower risk of tobacco use, compared to third generation youth. Additionally, immigrant boys who had been in the US ≤4 years had a significantly lower risk of alcohol use. Among both boys and girls, all first and second generation youth were significantly less likely to report marijuana use compared to third generation youth. Immigrant youth have a lower risk of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use relative to US born youth; however the protective effect of foreign nativity on alcohol was eroded much more quickly than for tobacco or marijuana. The effects of generation and time in US on substance use differ by gender and the particular substance.",1

Microsatellite markers (n = 182) were genotyped across the entire F2 population, all F1 parents and the paternal grandparents. Breed of origin of all chromosomal segments inherited in F2 progeny were predicted using GenoProb, where genotypic data, genetic maps and extended pedigrees were used as inputs. Statistical tests for quantitative trait loci (QTL) associations were conducted on 41 phenotypes with SAS using output from GenoProb for genotypic data. Fixed effects included sex and age at slaughter. For certain analyses carcass weight, RYR1 genotype and/or PRKAG3 genotype were also included as covariates. Subjective and objective measures of pork colour, marbling and tenderness were recorded, as well as measures of carcass fatness and muscularity. Test results were adjusted to a genome-wide level of significance. Five genomic regions presented significant evidence for QTL at chromosome 1 positions 6 cM (intramuscular fat) and 67 cM (Hunter L*), chromosome 2 position 62 cM (taste panel tenderness), chromosome 17 position 50 (loineye area and image analysis estimated loineye area) and X position 87 cM (carcass weight). Sixty-six suggestive associations were detected. Fourteen of these associations were within the regions with significant QTL on chromosomes 2, 17 and X, and the remaining 52 associations resided in 29 other regions on 13 different chromosomes of the porcine genome. The chromosome 2 region of 60-66 cM was associated with all measures of pork tenderness and the region on chromosome 17 (32-39 cM) was associated with both measures of intramuscular fat and loineye area. After verification, the QTL for marbling and tenderness should be useful in commercial production to improve pork quality as the population was developed from two of the three most utilized breeds of swine in the USA.",0
https://doi.org/10.1532/ijh97.e0529,Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Single-Center Study of Clinicopathologic Characteristics,"Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) is a subset of LBCL with unique clinicopathologic features. Some studies have raised the question of differences in biological features and clinical course among patients from different parts of the world. We conducted a retrospective clinicopathologic analysis of 24 patients with PMLBCL from a single center in Croatia. We also conducted the first investigation of the frequency of lymphotropic viruses human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and HHV-8 in lymphoid lesions of this disease.The clinical characteristics of the patients were as expected, with high International Prognostic Index scores, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and bulky disease being adverse prognostic factors. Only 6 patients (25%) showed CD30 expression, and Bcl-6 protein expression was, in our series, prognostically favorable (P = .0401). One patient’s tumor had detectable HHV-6 genome sequence, but no HHV-8 sequences were detected in any tumors. Two thirds of the patients received CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine, and prednisone) with a relatively low complete remission rate (43.8%; median follow-up, 33.8 months). This study confirmed the moderate preponderance among PMLBCL patients of young females with B symptoms and elevated LDH levels.The CHOP regimen proved effective as first-line therapy only in patients with limited disease. Therefore, other third-generation chemotherapy protocols may be considered for treatment, especially in patients with bulky and advanced disease.",0

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the illness behavior of parents, in the form of health care use for irritable bowel symptoms, and the illness behavior of their children, without relying on retrospective recall. METHODS: A comparison of two matched groups was made. Groups included 631 children of parents who were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome during 1 calendar yr and 646 children of parents matched by parental age, gender, and number of children in the family who did not receive an IBS diagnosis during the same 1 yr. Health care use and costs over a 3-yr calendar period for all children and their parents collected from the health care database of a large health maintenance organization were evaluated. RESULTS: Case children had significantly more ambulatory care visits for all causes (mean 12.26 vs 9.81, p = 0.0001) and more ambulatory visits for gastrointestinal symptoms (0.35 vs 0.18, p = 0.0001). Outpatient health care costs over the 3-yr period were also significantly higher for case than control children ($1979 vs $1546, p = 0.0001). Controlling for the total number of ambulatory visits of the parents, excluding gastrointestinal visits, did not alter the findings. Gender of the IBS parent was not related to children’s gastrointestinal visits. CONCLUSION: This study extends previous research by showing that specific types of illness behavior may be learned through modeling.",0

ALMN is expressed clinically by dysfunction of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and endocrine system. We stress that suspicion of this disorder be high in evaluating uncertain neurologic disorders, and that identification of one manifestation of this complex should alert the clinician to the possibility of a different expression of the same complex in other family members.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-01222-8_14,Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358) – A Novel Combined Pan-Aurora Kinases and Third Generation Bcr-Abl Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor,"The Aurora kinases belong to a family of highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinases. They play an essential role as key mitotic regulators, controlling entry into mitosis, centrosome function, chromosome assembly, and segregation. As many other regulators of mitosis, Aurora kinases are frequently found to be aberrantly overexpressed in cancer cells. Therefore, these proteins have become an attractive target for the development of new anticancer therapies. In fact, several small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have already been developed and some of them have shown promising clinical efficacy in a number of human tumors in Phase I and II clinical trials. Among those, one of the most advanced clinical compound currently is Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358), which exhibits inhibitory activity against all known Aurora kinases as well as other cancer-relevant kinases such as the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, including its multidrug-resistant T315I mutant. This mutation is responsible for up to 25% of all clinically observed resistances in CML patients undergoing Imatinib therapy. However, this particular mutation is predicted to play an even more important clinical role in the future, since in addition to Imatinib, it also confers resistance to second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors such as Nilotinib, Dasatinib, and Bosutinib. Therefore, combined Aurora and Bcr-Abl inhibition (the latter including high-grade resistance conferring mutations) with compounds such as Danusertib represents a promising new strategy for treatment of Bcr-Abl positive leukemias, especially those in second and third line of treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/10826089809056251,The Role of Intergenerational Discrepancy of Cultural Orientation in Drug Use among Latina Adolescents,"The role of intergenerational discrepancy for cultural orientation was examined in the etiology of drug use among Latina adolescents and in the context of family support. Intergenerational discrepancy occurs when a family member of one generation differs from a family member of another generation in cultural identity factors; this is usually manifested in conflict between a first generation child and the immigrant generation parent. It was hypothesized that the Latina adolescents experiencing intergenerational discrepancy might use drugs more frequently than Latina adolescents who were not; and that family support would be an important moderator of the relationship. A sample of 295 ninth and tenth grade Latina students (approximately 80% Mexican-American) from four Los Angeles area schools were surveyed as part of a larger study. In this secondary analysis, a 2 (family support ) x 2 (discrepancy) ANOVA revealed that intergenerational discrepancy was associated with more drug use in certain cases, and that family support did not moderate this relationship. Results partially validate and extend a theoretical model presented by Szapocznik and Kurtines (1980), and indicate a need to focus on cultural variables when intervening in drug use/misuse among Latina adolescents.",0

The health care system reform during the 1990s was an important component in accomplishing the last objective. Analyses of the policies adopted after the crisis of 2001 reveal that, despite the discourse against international financial institutions, President Nestor Kirchner, elected in 2002, followed the same approach by accepting and applying the second generation of health reforms recommended by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank with additional pressure from the World Trade Organization and several free trade agreements. This “new reform” furthered business opportunities for multinational corporations while further shrinking the state administration's role in supplying health, education, and other social services to people who need them more than ever. Social movements have emerged that are developing alternative projects and showing that, when the base is solidarity, “another world is possible.”",0

The following review considers the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, antimicrobial activity, clinical uses, and adverse effects of minocycline. Excellent tissue and secretion penetration due to its higher lipid solubility, good broad spectrum activity, superior gastrointestinal absorption, decreased alteration of the fecal flora, and prolonged half-life, are properties that make minocycline a unique antimicrobial agent. Despite these exceptional characteristics, minocycline remains an infrequently used agent because of the availability of alternate drugs and the vestibular dysfunction associated with its administration.",0

Slot-type preparations were made in bovine teeth, with gingival margins on dentin. Specimens were divided into 12 groups (n = 12) according to composite-light-curing unit (LCU) combinations. Three composites were used: Filtek Supreme, Herculite XRV, and Heliomolar. All restorations were placed using the same adhesive. Four LCUs were used: a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) LCU (Optilux 501), a first-generation light-emitting diode (LED) LCU (FreeLight 1), and two second-generation LED LCUs (FreeLight 2 and Translux Power Blue). After finishing and polishing, specimens were subjected to mechanical load cycling (100,000 cycles). Gingival margin adaptation was determined as a function of gap formation using epoxy replicas. Microleakage was evaluated by measuring dye penetration across the gingival wall in cross-sectioned specimens. Microhardness was measured as Knoop Hardness number (KHN) at different occluso-gingival locations in cross-sectioned specimens. Data were analyzed for statistical significance (p = 0.05) using appropriate statistical tests. Marginal adaptation was affected by load-cycling in most specimens, but no significant differences were observed among composites and LCUs. Microleakage was not affected by LCU, except for Heliomolar specimens which when cured with Optilux 501 resulted in higher microleakage scores than those obtained with the other LCUs. For microhardness, Translux Power Blue generally produced the highest values and the FreeLight 1 produced the lowest. The performance of the second-generation LED LCUs generally was similar to that of the QTH control, and better than that of the first-generation LED unit. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

https://doi.org/10.1097/01.all.0000244789.10863.c4,The effects of in-utero tobacco-toxin exposure on the respiratory system in children,"Promotion of cigarettes to children and women has resulted in unacceptably high rates of smoking during pregnancy in most developed countries and the potential to greatly increase smoking by mothers in developing countries. The risks of smoking during pregnancy to mothers and unborn children are well known and include growth retardation, respiratory diseases and sudden infant death syndrome. Determining the effects of exposure on the fetus depends upon accurate assessment of maternal smoking, both active and involuntary, and this can be done using self-reports and a variety of biomarkers in the mother and/or newborn.The evidence is clear that most of the excess respiratory morbidity in children born to smoking mothers is due to in-utero exposure and that deficits in lung function measured soon after birth persist in children and adults. Recent studies have also indicated that some children are genetically predisposed to adverse outcomes in response to in-utero exposure.Although many women attempt to quit during pregnancy and effective interventions are available, ultimately the respiratory health of future generations will depend upon effective public health and tobacco control measures designed to prevent smoking uptake by youth and in particular girls and young women.",0

,Access to allergy care: implications for quality healthcare and public safety.,"Some managed care companies are considering reducing or eliminating coverage for several second-generation antihistamines prescribed to treat patients with allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic hives, and other allergy-related conditions. Treatment options for all patients with allergic and immunologic diseases should reflect accepted standards of medical care. Prescription policies limiting coverage and/or use of second-generation antihistamines are medically inappropriate, below current national standards of practice in the field of allergic and immunologic diseases, and may increase health expenditures in the long-term. Any action to reduce or limit coverage will not only diminish the quality of medical care for allergy patients but have significant health and safety implications for the general public.",0

,The specific status of Anopheles minimus s.l. collected from Taiwan.,"At least three members (species A, C, and E) of the Anopheles minimus complex have been described in the Orient. This study investigated the specific status of An. minimus collected in the southern part of Taiwan by crossing experiments with species A from Thailand and species E from Japan. Crosses between Taiwan An. minimus and species A revealed genetic compatibilities. Post-zygotic isolation was observed in crosses between Taiwan An. minimus and species E. Hybrid progeny were only obtained from Taiwan female X species E male. F2 hybrid progeny were not obtained, since the hybrid males were sterile or almost sterile, with atrophied testes or abnormal spermatozoa. The hybrid females backcrossed with either Taiwan F1 progeny and species E males, and laid eggs with lower fertility and viability. This study supports previous published data regarding the analysis of the D3 region of the 28S gene of ribosomal DNA that An. minimus species A is indigenous to Taiwan. Whether other members of the An. minimus complex exist in Taiwan is not conclusive and needs more study.",0

The conditions for the HSSL biological treatment step by Paecilomyces variotii were evaluated and optimised. Two different strategies of reactor operation were compared using single batch (B) and sequential batch reactor (SBR). Biological treatment of HSSL in the SBR revealed the best results with respect to the removal of microbial inhibitors. Also, most of inhibitory compounds, acetic acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol, amongst others, were removed from HSSL by P. variotii before the ethanol fermentation. The bio-detoxified HSSL was subjected to a successful fermentation by P. stipitis, attaining a maximum ethanol concentration of 2.4 g L(-1) with a yield of 0.24 g ethanol g sugars(-1).",0

Based on a yeast reporter system, AhR-activating ligands similar in concentration to 2 ng/l of TCDD were detected in two canal waters in Guangzhou, China. In this study, a three-generation experiment was conducted to assess the reproductive and developmental risks associated with these waters in C57BL/6J female mice, including female reproduction, pup indices, reproductive hormone levels, and levels of AhR, ARNT, and CYP1A2 in the uterus. Similar reproductive toxic effects were produced in the offspring of mice that drank the canal water as would occur if they drank 2 ng/l/day TCDD. The major reproductive indices that were affected included mating time and gestation length over all the generations. A striking finding is the TCDD (2 ng/l) and the water samples significantly reduced Day 4 pup survival rates in the F2 and F3. Both TCDD exposure and drinking canal water decreased estradiol-17β (E2) levels in the multiparous females and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and E2 levels in the virgin females. Immunochemical staining revealed that the AhR and CYP1A2 positive signals were enhanced, and the ARNT positive signal was weakened in the uteri of mice drinking water with TCDD (2 ng/l) and the canal water samples. These results imply that the canal water contains AhR ligands that could induce similar toxic effects as do low levels of TCDD. Exposure to these contaminants can significantly impair the reproductive health of female mice. Considering this canals are open directly to Pearl River, whether these effects could be caused in human reproduction and development warrants further study.",1
https://doi.org/10.1021/bi0342822,"Crystal Structure of Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase Toho-1: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism for Catalytic Reaction and Substrate Specificity Expansion<sup>,</sup>","The crystallographic structure of the class A beta-lactamase Toho-1, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with potent activity against expanded-spectrum cephems, has been determined at 1.65 A resolution. The result reveals that the Lys73 side chain can adopt two alternative conformations. The predominant conformation of Lys73 is different from that observed in the E166A mutant, indicating that removal of the Glu166 side chain changes the conformation of the Lys73 side chain and thus the interaction between Lys73 and Glu166. The Lys73 side chain would play an important role in proton relay, switching its conformation from one to the other depending on the circumstances. The electron density map also implies possible rotation of Ser237. Comparison of the Toho-1 structure with the structure of other class A beta-lactamases shows that the hydroxyl group of Ser237 is likely to rotate through interaction with the carboxyl group of the substrate. Another peculiarity is the existence of three sulfate ions positioned in or near the substrate-binding cavity. One of these sulfate ions is tightly bound to the active center, while the other two are held by a region of positive charge formed by two arginine residues, Arg274 and Arg276. This positively charged region is speculated to represent a pseudo-binding site of the beta-lactam antibiotics, presumably catching the methoxyimino group of the third-generation cephems prior to proper binding in the substrate-binding cleft for hydrolysis. This high-resolution structure, together with detailed kinetic analysis of Toho-1, provides a new hypothesis for the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of Toho-1.",0

Concentrations of 8-epi-PGF<sub>2α</sub> in the range 1 nM to 1 µM induce a dose-dependent increase in platelet shape change, in calcium release from intracellular stores [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and in inositol phosphates; it also causes irreversible platelet aggregation, dependent on thromboxane generation, when incubated with subthreshold concentrations of ADP, thrombin, collagen, and arachidonic acid. Much higher concentrations of 8-epi-PGF<sub>2α</sub> (10–20 µM) alone induce weak, reversible aggregation. Although these effects are prevented by pharmacological thromboxane receptor antagonists, they are unlikely to be mediated by thromboxane receptors. Thus, 8-epi-PGF<sub>2α</sub> does not compete for binding at the stably expressed placental or endothelial isoforms of the thromboxane receptor or for binding of thromboxane ligands to human platelets. Furthermore, the response to 8-epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> exhibits structural specificity <i>versus</i> 8-epi PGF<sub>3α</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub>. Concentrations in the range that evoke its effects on platelets do not desensitize the aggregation response stimulated by thromboxane or PGH<sub>2</sub> analogs. Unlike primary prostaglandins, which are rapidly metabolized to inactive products, 8-epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> circulates in plasma. However, the systemic concentrations found in healthy volunteers (median 48 pmol/liter) and in patients with hepatic cirrhosis (median 147 pmol/liter), a syndrome of oxidant stress <i>in vivo,</i> fall well below those which modulate platelet function. 8-Epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> may amplify the response to platelet agonists in syndromes where oxidant stress and platelet activation coincide. Despite blockade by thromboxane antagonists, 8-epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> does not activate either of the thromboxane receptor isoforms described in platelets. Activation of a distinct receptor would be consistent with the enzymatic formation of 8-epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> by cyclooxygenases. However, incidental activation of such a receptor by systemic concentrations of 8-epi PGF<sub>2α</sub> is unlikely to occur, even in syndromes of excessive free radical generation <i>in vivo.</i>",0

Survivors cannot live without their memory, nor is it possible for them to conceive of a life unencumbered by this constant ""contaminant"". It is not possible to integrate the persecution experiences.

In HIV-infected patients, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has altered this epidemic in many countries and simpler, better-tolerated treatment regimens have resulted in many patients with HIV living longer and with an improved quality of life. In patients with severe mental illness, second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) or atypical antipsychotics have provided hope for many patients and families struggling with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Despite these advances in treatment, metabolic abnormalities, specifically the metabolic syndrome (MetS), are occurring at a greater incidence in both persons with HIV and persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, patients with severe mental illness are becoming HIV-infected, and higher prevalence rates of severe mental illness are seen in HIV patients than the general population. This review examines the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities within each population and the impact of HAART and SGAs on the development of MetS. Overviewed are possible mechanisms for the development of MetS in these patients, standard monitoring protocols, and potential treatments for managing these metabolic issues. Finally, recommendations for monitoring and managing the intersecting, growing population of HIV/AIDS patients with severe mental illness are provided.",0

The preponderance of the evidence suggests that antidepressants prescribed to improve substance-related symptoms among patients with mood and anxiety disorders are either not highly effective or involve risk due to high side-effect profiles or toxicity. Second generation antipsychotics are more effective for treatment of schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse and current evidence suggests clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone are among the best. Clozapine appears to be the most effective of the antipsychotics for reducing alcohol, cocaine and cannabis abuse among patients with schizophrenia. Motivational interviewing has robust support as a highly effective psychotherapy for establishing a therapeutic alliance. This finding is critical since retention in treatment is essential for maintaining effectiveness. Highly structured therapy programs that integrate intensive outpatient treatments, case management services and behavioral therapies such as Contingency Management (CM) are most effective for treatment of severe comorbid conditions.Creative combinations of psychotherapies, behavioral and pharmacological interventions offer the most effective treatment for comorbidity. Intensity of treatment must be increased for severe comorbid conditions such as the schizophrenia/cannabis dependence comorbidity due to the limitations of pharmacological treatments.",0

After a 6-week treatment with nebivolol, with very good tolerability and neutral metabolic effects, systolic BP was significantly decreased (in male from initial 165?19 to 129?12 mm Hg, and female from initial 169?22 to 132?15 mm Hg at the end of the study; average decrease 22.3%, p&lt;0.001) and as well as diastolic BP (male from initial 103?12 to 79?6 mm Hg and female from initial 100?9 to 82?7 mm Hg, average decrease 22.6%; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. After a 6-week treatment nebivolol significantly decreased systolic and diastolic BP in patients with mild and moderate AH, independently of the sex.",0

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050239,Heritable Stochastic Switching Revealed by Single-Cell Genealogy,"The partitioning and subsequent inheritance of cellular factors like proteins and RNAs is a ubiquitous feature of cell division. However, direct quantitative measures of how such nongenetic inheritance affects subsequent changes in gene expression have been lacking. We tracked families of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as they switch between two semi-stable epigenetic states. We found that long after two cells have divided, they continued to switch in a synchronized manner, whereas individual cells have exponentially distributed switching times. By comparing these results to a Poisson process, we show that the time evolution of an epigenetic state depends initially on inherited factors, with stochastic processes requiring several generations to decorrelate closely related cells. Finally, a simple stochastic model demonstrates that a single fluctuating regulatory protein that is synthesized in large bursts can explain the bulk of our results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.145.11.1396,Family planning and child mental health in China: the Nanjing Survey,"The authors studied the impact of China's one-child-per-couple family planning policy on child development in 697 preschool children in the city of Nanjing and in two rural areas surrounding Nanjing. A home-visit questionnaire survey including a Chinese version of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist was used. The behavior problem profiles of children who were their parents' only children and those who had siblings were compared, revealing a significant difference between girls who were only children and those who had siblings. Girls who were only children tended to have slightly higher scores on the factors of depression, moody, and temper.The 1 child per family policy was begun in China in 1980 in order to keep the population down to 1.15 billion by year 2000. By 1985, 80-90% of urban families and 50-60% of rural families had only 1 child. This study of 697 children aged 3-6 in urban, suburban-rural, and remote rural areas in and around Nanjing was designed to determine whether only children developed significantly more behavior problems than did children with siblings. The survey used the Child and Family Questionnaire and a Chinese version of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. The age of the parents ranged from 25-40 years, and 99% of the marriages were not arranged. 60% of the families were nuclear, and 40% were stem, i.e., the married couple lived with either the husband's or the wife's parents. Only 1/4 of the families had wanted children for traditional reasons, such as to continue a clan, to provide labor, or to provide old-age security. 29% had wanted only 1 child, 63% preferred 2, and 3% preferred 3 children. The remote rural families wanted the most children. 54% of families indicated no preference for a boy or a girl, and 51.59% of the children were boys, and 48.5% were girls. 71% of the children attended public day care institutions and were thus exposed to socialization even if they were only children. 89% of the children slept in the same bed as their parents, the usual custom in China. Behavior problems included in the questionnaire were immaturity, regression, schizoid behavior, depression, moodiness, neuroses, and aggression. Single factor and multifactor analyses of variance were used to determine the effects of demographic variables and presence or absence of siblings on behavior problems. Boys who were only children and who were cared for by grandparents had more anxious aggression than only children cared for by parents. But boys who had siblings and were cared for by grandparents scored lower for anxious aggression. All boys who were cared for by grandparents had more anxious aggression than boys cared for by parents. Girls who were only children of parents who preferred 2 children scored high for moodiness, but girls who had siblings and whose parents preferred 1 child had highest scores for obsessive-neurotic behavior and aggression. Girls who were only children and lived in rural areas had higher temper scores than did only children girls in the country. But for girls with siblings temper scores were higher in the city. Girls who were only children and lived in nuclear families had higher temper scores than those who lived in stem families, but girls who had siblings and lived in nuclear families had lower temper scores than those who lived in stem families. In general, the behavior patterns of only children were significantly different only for boys. The results of this study indicate that the 1 child per family policy will not result in problem behavior among children.",0

In European countries, focus has been directed on information, education and communication (IEC) activities for soldiers. Military cooperation on a program to implement IEC activities for young soldiers in Turkey and Bulgaria has been documented. In addition, migration and male reproductive health behavior is addressed in an initiative by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia. However, discussions on male involvement in reproductive health services points out that new initiatives for male participants should not come at the expense of programs for women. Furthermore, the need to male involvement in sexual and reproductive health services should identify men's perspective, concerns and specific problem, as well as the establishment of clinics and services for the exclusive use of men.",0
https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.027987,Controlling for the Effects of History and Nonequilibrium Conditions in Gene Flow Estimates in Northern Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) Populations,"Abstract Nonequilibrium conditions due to either allopatry followed by secondary contact or recent range expansion can confound measurements of gene flow among populations in previously glaciated regions. We determined the scale at which gene flow can be estimated among breeding aggregations of bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) at the northern limit of their range in Ontario, Canada, using seven highly polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. We first identified breeding aggregations that likely share a common history, determined from the pattern of allelic richness, factorial correspondence analysis, and a previously published mtDNA phylogeography, and then tested for regional equilibrium by evaluating the association between pairwise FST and geographic distance. Regional breeding aggregations in eastern Ontario separated by &amp;lt;100 km were determined to be at or near equilibrium. High levels of gene flow were measured using traditional F-statistics and likelihood estimates of Nm. Similarly high levels of recent migration (past one to three generations) were estimated among the breeding aggregations using nonequilibrium methods. We also show that, in many cases, breeding aggregations separated by up to tens of kilometers are not genetically distinct enough to be considered separate genetic populations. These results have important implications both for the identification of independent “populations” and in assessing the effect of scale in detecting patterns of genetic equilibrium and gene flow.",1

They were compared to controls without heredity for hypertension. The differences in BP and HR at rest between the groups were maintained throughout all tests, but during heavy dynamic muscle work systolic BP rose less in relatives than in controls. When relatives and controls were divided into subgroups, we found that BP was more related to age in relatives than in controls, both at rest and during the provocation tests. The differences in BP between the groups could thus depend on a genetic factor with greater penetration with increasing age.",0

https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2009-0500,Maternal High-Fat Diet Promotes Body Length Increases and Insulin Insensitivity in Second-Generation Mice,"Maternal obesity and diet consumption during pregnancy have been linked to offspring adiposity, cardiovascular disease, and impaired glucose metabolism. Furthermore, nutrition during development is clearly linked to somatic growth. However, few studies have examined whether phenotypes derived from maternal high-fat diet exposure can be passed to subsequent generations and by what mechanisms this may occur. Here we report the novel finding of a significant body length increase that persisted across at least two generations of offspring in response to maternal high-fat diet exposure. This phenotype is not attributable to altered intrauterine conditions or maternal feeding behavior because maternal and paternal lineages were able to transmit the effect, supporting a true epigenetic manner of inheritance. We also detected a heritable feature of reduced insulin sensitivity across two generations. Alterations in the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the GHSR transcriptional repressor AF5q31, plasma IGF-I concentrations, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) suggest a contribution of the GH axis. These studies provide evidence that the heritability of body length and glucose homeostasis are modulated by maternal diet across multiple generations, providing a mechanism where length can increase rapidly in concert with caloric availability.",0
,Clinical features in 4 Chinese families with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL),"Objective Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited cerebral arteriolar disease in adulthood, which is caused by NOTCH3 gene mutation. The main symptoms were migraine, cerebral stroke, later with mood disorders and dementia in Caucasian patients. Recently, the disease was also recognized in Asian patients, in whom the migraine is rarely reported. In order to give the clinical features of Chinese patients, we described the clinical symptoms in 4 CADASIL families. Methods CADASIL was diagnosed by the investigation of ultra-structure changes of arteriole in sural nerve and NOTCH3 gene mutation in the 4 index cases. Detailed clinical and routine laboratory examinations were performed in these 4 patients, including electrocardiography, nerve conduction velocity, serum glycogen, and serum homocysteine. Additionally, we also collected the clinical data of the other 83 family members through interviews and the available medical records. Results Of the 83 persons, 29 were classified as clinical suspected patients, who presented one or more of the disease-related neurological symptoms, such as cerebral ischemic events and the cognitive impairment. All of them showed no common risk factors for stroke, such as diabetic mellitus, hypertension, and heart disease. The clinical suspected patients distributed in every consecutive generations and involved both sexes, which was according to the autosomal dominant inherited pattern. The onset age of the disease ranged from 28 to 70-year-old and mainly between the 4th and the 5th decades. The main symptoms were recurrent episodic vertigo, with or without hemiplegia. At the same time or a little bit later, the cognitive impairment was developed in some patients. Compared with the typical presentations of the disease in European patients, none of our 29 patients showed migraine,one index case showed mild sensory disturbance in extremities. Elevated serum homocysteine level and abnormal of nerve conduction study in two index cases (3 and 4) were noticed. Conclusion The onset age of the disease of our patients is similar to that of Caucasian patients. The main symptoms were stroke and dementia. Involvement of post circulation system was the main clinical feature for ischemic events in our patients. Dementia could be found in the early stage of disease. Migraine should not be regarded as a common clinical feature in our patients. The involvement of the peripheral nerves expanded the disease expression outside the central nervous system.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2007.07.026,Focal liver lesions: Role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound,"The introduction of microbubble contrast agents and the development of contrast-specific techniques have opened new possibilities in liver imaging. Initially, only intermittent imaging with Doppler detection was available. Second-generation contrast agents and low mechanical index real-time scanning techniques are decisive advances that enable convenient liver examinations with high sensitivity and specificity. Hepatic lesions usually show typical perfusion and enhancement patterns through the various contrast phases, which help their characterization. Several published studies and the daily clinical routine show that, as opposed to conventional ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced US can substantially improve detection and differentiation of focal liver lesions. Today, contrast-enhanced US is the dynamic imaging modality of choice for differentiation of focal liver lesions. Contrast uptake patterns of the most relevant liver lesions, as well as important clinical indications are presented and discussed.",0

Examinations, morphological and physiological, on functions of the thyroid of the animals exposed to methiocil, revealed that the standard procedures of methiocil administration mentioned above could result in hypofunction of the thyroid. Male and female Wistar rats treated with methiocil in the standard fashion were mated to obtain F1 animals (offspring). These F1 animals, when 90 days old, were also treated with methiocil in the standard fashion, and were mated to obtain F2 animals (Second generation offspring). F3 and F4 animals (successive generations) were obtained also by the same procedures. Measurements of the body weight, serum PBI, total cholesterol and I131 uptake, and histological and histometrical studies on the thyroid gland and other endocrine organs were performed in 17, 14, 14, and 11 cases of the F1, F2 F3 and F4 animals, respectively, and in 37 cases of normal rats. The results obtained illustrate that a progressively increasing hypofunction of the thyroid gland could be induced in offspring rats treated with methiocil for successive generations.",1

We detected 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 13q14, one (rs6313) present at the HTR2A locus and the other 6 at the KPNA3 locus, among 124 British family trios consisting of mother, father and affected offspring with schizophrenia. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) showed allelic association for rs3736830 (chi(2)=8.66, P=0.003), rs2181185 (chi(2)=3.86, P=0.049) and rs626716 (chi(2)=5.82, P=0.016), but not for rs6313 (chi(2)=0.009, P=0.926). The global P-value was 0.029 for 1000 permutations with the TDT. The 2-SNP haplotype analysis showed a disease association for the rs2273816-rs3736830 haplotypes (chi(2)=7.63, d.f.=2, P=0.022), the rs3736830-rs2181185 haplotypes (chi(2)=10.30, d.f.=2, P=0.006) and the rs2181185-rs3782929 haplotypes (chi(2)=9.26, d.f.=2, P=0.01). The global P-value was 0.034 for 1000 permutations with the 2-SNP haplotype analysis. The 6-SNP haplotype system also showed a weak association with the illness (chi(2)=15.62, d.f.=8, P=0.048), although the 1-d.f. test did not show the association for nine individual haplotypes when a P-value was corrected by the Bonferroni corrections. The present study suggests that the KPNA3 may contribute genetically to schizophrenia in a small effect size.",0
https://doi.org/10.1603/022.038.0445,Frequency of<i>Bt</i>Resistance Alleles in<i>H. armigera</i>During 2006–2008 in Northern China,"Helicoverpa armigera is an important lepidopteran pest of cotton in China. From 2002, the frequency of Bt resistance alleles and quantitative shifts in larval Cry1Ac tolerance of field H. armigera population were monitored using bioassays of F(1) and F(2) offspring of isofemale lines from Xiajin County of Shandong Province (an intensive Bt cotton planting area) and Anci County of Hebei Province (a multiple-crop system including corn, soybean, peanut, and Bt cotton) in northern China. During 2006-2008, a total of 2,306 isofemale lines from the Xiajin population and a total of 1,270 isofemale lines from the Anci population were successfully screened on Cry1Ac diets. For each year, it was estimated that the major resistance gene frequency in Xiajin population in 2006, 2007, and 2008 was 0, 0.00022, and 0.00033, respectively. No major alleles conferring resistance to Cry1Ac were found in the Anci population; the frequency of resistance alleles for Cry1Ac was 0. Based on the relative average development rates (RADRs) of H. armigera larvae in F(1) tests, no substantial increase in Cry1Ac tolerance was found in either location over the 3-yr period. There were also significantly positive correlations between RADR of lines in the F(1) generation and the RADR of their F(2) offspring, indicating genetic variation in response to toxin. The low frequency of resistance alleles found in this study and in our previous results from 2002 to 2005 suggest the frequency of resistance alleles has remained low and that natural refugia resistance management strategy maybe effective for delaying resistance evolution in H. armigera to Bt cotton in northern China.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.8-4-335,Advances in Endocrine Treatments for Postmenopausal Women with Metastatic and Early Breast Cancer,"For the past 25 years, the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen has been the hormonal treatment of choice for postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic and early breast cancer (EBC). However, tamoxifen is associated with certain tolerability and safety concerns. In addition, the hormonal options after progression are limited, and thus, alternative endocrine treatments have been developed. This review provides a synopsis of the newer alternatives in endocrine therapy of breast cancer: the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and fulvestrant Faslodex), the estrogen receptor antagonist that downregulates estrogen and progesterone receptors and has no known agonist activity. The third-generation AIs, anastrozole and letrozole, have been shown to be as effective or more effective than megestrol acetate and tamoxifen as second- and first-line therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, and exemestane has been approved for second-line use. Fulvestrant has been shown to be as effective as anastrozole as second-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer and has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer following progression on antiestrogen therapy. Anastrozole is the only AI with published clinical trial data and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with EBC. The 'Arimidex,' Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, a double-blind, multicenter trial with 9,366 patients, compared tamoxifen with anastrozole, alone and in combination, as adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal patients with operable, invasive, EBC. The first analysis (at a median follow-up of 33.3 months) showed longer disease-free survival and, in general, better tolerability with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. This pattern was maintained at later analyses with a median follow-up of 47 months for efficacy and 37 months for safety and tolerability. Although longer follow-up is warranted, anastrozole appears to be a well-documented choice of endocrine adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.",0

ACTH and T3 were almost doubled in the lymphocytes of vitamin A treated mothers' offspring, while histamine decreased to a one-third in the histamine content of vitamin D treated mothers' offspring. Part of the animals received vitamin treatment again 24 hours before measurement, however, only endorphin content elevated moderately. In the offspring of untreated dams administered with vitamin D 24 hours before measurement, each cell type studied (lymphocyte, monocyte-granulocyte group, mast cell) had a one-third lower T3 content, which shows that vitamin D treatment can influence hormone content of immune cells.

The MEDLINE search was updated to December 2010 for long-term clinical outcomes.Two reviewers independently screened reports and identified 140 trials and 26 observational studies of head-to-head comparisons of monotherapy or combination therapy that reported intermediate or long-term clinical outcomes or harms.Two reviewers following standardized protocols serially extracted data, assessed applicability, and independently evaluated study quality.Evidence on long-term clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy) was of low strength or insufficient. Most medications decreased the hemoglobin A(1c) level by about 1 percentage point and most 2-drug combinations produced similar reductions. Metformin was more efficacious than the DPP-4 inhibitors, and compared with thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas, the mean differences in body weight were about -2.5 kg. Metformin decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, and DPP-4 inhibitors. Sulfonylureas had a 4-fold higher risk for mild or moderate hypoglycemia than metformin alone and, in combination with metformin, had more than a 5-fold increased risk compared with metformin plus thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones increased risk for congestive heart failure compared with sulfonylureas and increased risk for bone fractures compared with metformin. Diarrhea occurred more often with metformin than with thiazolidinediones.Only English-language publications were reviewed. Some studies may have selectively reported outcomes. Many studies were small, were of short duration, and had limited ability to assess clinically important harms and benefits.Evidence supports metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. Most 2-drug combinations similarly reduce hemoglobin A(1c) levels, but some increased risk for hypoglycemia and other adverse events.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",0

However, when transplacental administration of ENU was combined in postnatal life with a brief dietary exposure to 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and a two-thirds partial hepatectomy, numerous focal hyperplastic lesions of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive hepatocytes emerged in the liver of the progeny. On the other hand, rats of F2 generation born of F1 parents and F3 rats born of F2 parents showed no increase in the incidence of hepatic lesions after treatment with the same dietary regimen. It was suggested that direct interaction between fetal liver cells and the carcinogen is important for occurrence of initiated hepatocytes and that the initiation effect on rat liver by ENU does not persist in the descendants of F2 and F3 generations.",1

The effects were experienced both on a personal level and on interpersonal and social levels. Half of the women were separated, and in all but one, sexual life was affected in negative and long-lasting ways. The effects of childlessness were especially increased at the time the study was conducted, as the women's peer group was entering the 'grandparent phase'. Many coped with their childlessness by caring for others, such as the children of friends or relatives, elderly parents or animals.These findings represent a small sample, but they point towards the need for developing models of counselling and support that stimulate self-reflection and strengthen personal resources and empowerment for individuals and couples experiencing involuntary childlessness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(02)01139-7,Unusual Binding Mode of an HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor Explains its Potency against Multi-drug-resistant Virus Strains,"Protease inhibitors (PIs) are an important class of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection. However, in the course of treatment, resistant viral variants with reduced sensitivity to PIs often emerge and become a major obstacle to successful control of viral load. On the basis of a compound equipotently inhibiting HIV-1 and 2 proteases (PR), we have designed a pseudopeptide inhibitor, QF34, that efficiently inhibits a wide variety of PR variants. In order to analyze the potency of the inhibitor, we constructed PR species harboring the typical (signature) mutations that confer resistance to commercially available PIs. Kinetic analyses showed that these mutated PRs were inhibited up to 1,000-fold less efficiently by the clinically approved PIs. In contrast, all PR species were effectively inhibited by QF34. In a clinical study, we have monitored 30 HIV-positive patients in the Czech Republic undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy, and have identified highly PI resistant variants. Kinetic analyses revealed that QF34 retained its subnanomolar potency against multi-drug resistant PR variants. X-ray crystallographic analysis and molecular modeling experiments explained the wide specificity of QF34: this inhibitor binds to the PR in an unusual manner, thus avoiding contact sites that are mutated upon resistance development, and the unusual binding mode and consequently the binding energy is therefore preserved in the complex with a resistant variant. These results suggest a promising route for the design of second-generation PIs that are active against a variety of resistant PR variants.",0

The effects of fetal programming may not be limited to the first-generation offspring. We have explored intergenerational effects in the dexamethasone-programmed rat, a model in which fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoid results in low birth weight with subsequent adult hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia underpinned by increased activity of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). We found that the male offspring of female rats that had been exposed prenatally to dexamethasone, but were not manipulated in their own pregnancy, also had reduced birth weight (5.66 +/- 0.06 vs. 6.12 +/- 0.06 g, P < 0.001), glucose intolerance, and elevated hepatic PEPCK activity (5.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.2 nmol.min(-1).mg protein(-1), P < 0.001). These effects resolved in a third generation. Similar intergenerational programming was observed in offspring of male rats exposed prenatally to dexamethasone mated with control females. The persistence of such programming effects through several generations, transmitted by either maternal or paternal lines, indicates the potential importance of epigenetic factors in the intergenerational inheritance of the ""programming phenotype"" and provides a basis for the inherited association between low birth weight and cardiovascular risk factors.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/nrendo.2010.215,Transgenerational neuroendocrine disruption of reproduction,"Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is associated with dysfunctions of metabolism, energy balance, thyroid function and reproduction, and an increased risk of endocrine cancers. These multifactorial disorders can be 'programmed' through molecular epigenetic changes induced by exposure to EDCs early in life, the expression of which may not manifest until adulthood. In some cases, EDCs have detrimental effects on subsequent generations, which indicates that traits for disease predisposition may be passed to future generations by nongenomic inheritance. This Review discusses current understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie sexual differentiation of reproductive neuroendocrine systems in mammals and summarizes the literature on transgenerational epigenetic effects of representative EDCs: vinclozolin, diethylstilbesterol, bisphenol A and polychlorinated biphenyls. The article differentiates between context-dependent epigenetic transgenerational changes--namely, those that require environmental exposure, either via the EDC itself or through behavioral or physiological differences in parents--and germline-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. These processes, albeit discrete, are not mutually exclusive and can involve similar molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone modifications and may predispose exposed individuals to transgenerational disruption of reproductive processes. New insights stress the crucial need to develop a clear understanding of how EDCs may program the epigenome of exposed individuals and their descendants.",1

Subtype IIB vWD and autosomal dominant inheritance was identified in 19 individuals with bleeding signs varying in severity and frequency. The absence of high molecular weight multimers of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWf) and the heightened interaction of plasma vWf with platelets in the presence of low ristocetin concentrations were consistent in all affected subjects. Nevertheless the degree of these abnormalities was variable without clearcut linkage to the severity of clinical symptoms. Thrombocytopenia was present only in the adult affected family members and the platelet count appeared to be age-dependent. The investigation of this family provides further evidence of the phenotypic variability in the vWf-platelet interactions within this vWD subtype.,0

https://doi.org/10.1007/pl00012514,Cellular and molecular aspects of drugs of the future: oxaliplatin,"Oxaliplatin (Eloxatine) is a third-generation platinum compound which has shown a wide antitumour effect both in vitro and in vivo, a better safety profile than cisplatin and a lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin. In this scenario, oxaliplatin may represent an innovative and challenging drug extending the antitumour activity in diseases such as gastrointestinal cancer that are not usually sensitive to these coordination complexes. Oxaliplatin has a non-hydrolysable diaminocyclohexane (DACH) carrier ligand which is maintained in the final cytotoxic metabolites of the drug. Like cisplatin, oxaliplatin targets DNA producing mainly 1,2-GG intrastrand cross-links. The cellular and molecular aspects of the mechanism of action of oxaliplatin have not yet been fully elucidated. However, the intrinsic chemical and steric characteristics of the DACH-platinum adducts appear to contribute to the lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin. To date, mismatch repair and replicative bypass appear to be the processes most likely involved in differentiating the molecular responses to these agents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/cc8161,Variations in arterial blood pressure are associated with parallel changes in FlowTrac/Vigileo®-derived cardiac output measurements: a prospective comparison study,"IntroductionThe reliability of autocalibrated pressure waveform analysis by the FloTrac-Vigileo® (FTV) system for the determination of cardiac output in comparison with intermittent pulmonary arterial thermodilution (IPATD) is controversial. The present prospective comparison study was designed to determine the effects of variations in arterial blood pressure on the reliability of the FTV system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).MethodsComparative measurements of cardiac output by FTV (derived from a femoral arterial line; software version 1.14) and IPATD were performed in 16 patients undergoing elective CABG in the period before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia, after sternotomy, and during five time points during graft preparation. During graft preparation, arterial blood pressure was increased stepwise in intervals of 10 to 15 minutes by infusion of noradrenaline and lowered thereafter to baseline levels.ResultsMean arterial blood pressure was varied between 85 mmHg and 115 mmHg. IPATD cardiac output did not show significant changes during periods with increased arterial pressure either during sternotomy or after pharmacological manipulation. In contrast, FTV cardiac output paralleled changes in arterial blood pressure; i.e. increased significantly if blood pressure was raised and decreased upon return to baseline levels. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and FTV cardiac output were closely correlated (r = 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 - 0.74), P < 0.0001) while no correlation between MAP and IPATD cardiac output was observed. Bland-Altman analyses for FTV versus IPATD cardiac output measurements revealed a bias of 0.4 l/min (8.5%) and limits of agreement from 2.1 to -1.3 l/min (42.2 to -25.3%).ConclusionsAcute variations in arterial blood pressure alter the reliability of the FlowTrac/Vigileo® device with the second-generation software. This finding may help to explain the variable results of studies comparing the FTV system with other cardiac output monitoring techniques, questions the usefulness of this device for hemodynamic monitoring of patients undergoing rapid changes in arterial blood pressure, and should be kept in mind when using vasopressors during FTV-guided hemodynamic optimization.",0

A third-generation ELISA that uses 22F polysaccharide inhibition has increased the specificity of the assay, particularly at low antibody concentrations. The present work compared various 22F ELISAs and non-22F ELISAs. The comparisons involved three different laboratories, including a WHO reference laboratory, and included sera from subjects from different geographic areas immunized with different pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, including the licensed 7-valent Prevenar vaccine and the 10-valent Synflorix vaccine. All comparisons led to the same conclusion that the threshold defined as 0.35 μg/ml for the WHO non-22F ELISA is lower when any 22F ELISA is used. The use of highly purified polysaccharides for coating further improved the specificity of the assay. In conclusion, we confirm that the 22F ELISA can be recommended as a reference method for the determination of antibodies against pneumococcal polysaccharides.",0

Patients were required to have filled one additional antipsychotic prescription during follow-up. Adherence measures included medication possession ratio (MPR), medication persistence, medication consistency, and maximum gap in treatment. Multivariate logistic regression models identified predictors of nonadherence and hospitalization.Patients were considered adherent if they had an MPR ≥ .8. A total of 12,032 patients met selection criteria. The mean ± SD MPR was .79 ± .23, medication persistence was 94.1% ± 16.4%, medication consistency was 83.3% ± 16.4%, and the maximum gap in treatment was 29.7 ± 41.4 days. Thirty-seven percent of patients were hospitalized for any cause, and 32% had a psychiatric hospitalization. Predictors of nonadherence included newly starting treatment; younger age; a substance abuse diagnosis; use of a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, anxiolytic, or anticholinergic; and receipt of long-acting first-generation antipsychotics. Receipt of long-acting second-generation therapy or receipt of both first- and second-generation medications was associated with lower likelihood of nonadherence. Predictors of hospitalization risk included a diagnosis of other psychoses or substance abuse, anticholinergic use, and nonadherence to therapy.Results document rates of antipsychotic adherence and predictors of nonadherence and hospitalization. Findings may be useful to health plan administrators, formulary decision makers, and physicians.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(75)90061-6,Mitochondrial DNA synthesis in cell cycle mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Mitochondrial DNA replication was examined in mutants for seven different Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes which are essential for nuclear DNA replication. In cdc8 and cdc21, mutants defective in continued replication during the S phase of the cell cycle, mitochondrial DNA replication ceases at the nonpermissive temperature. Replication is temperature sensitive even when these mutants are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with alpha factor, a condition where mitochondrial DNA replication continues for the equivalent of several generations at the permissive temperature. Therefore the cessation of replication results from a defect in mitochondrial replication per se, rather than from an indirect consequence of cells being blocked in a phase of the cell cycle where mitochondrial DNA is not normally synthesized. Since the temperature-sensitive mutations are recessive, the products of genes cdc8 and cdc21 must be required for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. In contrast to cdc8 and cdc21, mitochondrial DNA replication continues for a long time at the nonpermissive temperature in five other cell division cycle mutants in which nuclear DNA synthesis ceases within one cell cycle: cdc4, cdc7, and cdc28, which are defective in the initiation of nuclear DNA synthesis, and cdc14 and cdc23, which are defective in nuclear division. The products of these genes, therefore, are apparently not required for the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication.",0

When 10(5) cells per 60 mm dish were exposed to MNNG for 4 h in Ham's medium F10 containing 0.02 M HEPES buffer at pH 6.8, MNNG concentrations of less than 1 X 10(-6) M resulted in cell survivals near 100%, while the average survival was less than one percent at concentrations greater than 5 X 10(-6) M. After treatment with MNNG, cells were subjected to selection using optimal conditions for the detection of diploid human fibroblasts that are resistant to the guanine-analogs AG and TG because they contain altered or deficient HPRT. The induced mutant frequency was maximized by allowing a 5 to 7 day post-treatment interval for the expression of the mutant phenotype and by replating the cells at the beginning of selection at a population density of less than 450 cells per cm2. Careful attention was given to counting statistically adequate numbers of mutants and to accurately determining cell survival and replating cloning efficiencies. Independent dose-response experiments gave induced mutant frequencies as high as 7.0 X 10(-4) to 8.8 X 10(-4) mutants per viable cell at about 5% survival, compared to a spontaneous mutation rate of 3.7 X 10(-6) to 7.2 X 10(-6) mutants per cell generation.

This study aimed to determine psychotropic drug prescription patterns and the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for schizophrenia and their changes over time in a large psychiatric institution in Beijing, China.The case notes of inpatients with schizophrenia were scrutinized to identify psychotropic drug prescription patterns and the use of ECT on November 10, 1999 and the same calendar day in 2008 and to compare the two surveys.In 1999, 45.1% of inpatients with schizophrenia were on first-generation antipsychotic drugs (FGA), while 52.9% were on second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGA). In 2008, the percentage of patients on FGAs decreased to 15.1%, while those on SGAs increased to 77.2%. The proportion of schizophrenia patients on mood stabilizers and antidepressants rose from 3.3% and 4.3% in 1999 to 18% and 9.5% by 2008, respectively. Use of ECT grew from 0.5% in 1999 to 5.6% by 2008. The proportion of schizophrenia patients not prescribed antipsychotic drugs changed from 5.6% in 1999 to 13.7% in 2008.The prescription pattern of psychotropic drugs changes considerably over time, even in the same clinical setting. Mental health professionals need to keep up with changes in the prescription patterns of psychotropic drugs in order to serve their patients at the best possible level. The socio-economic reasons for not prescribing antipsychotic drugs to schizophrenia patients should be further explored.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11745-008-3236-8,Molecular Evolution of a Steroid Hydroxylating Cytochrome P450 Using a Versatile Steroid Detection System for Screening,"Molecular evolution is a powerful tool for improving or changing activities of enzymes for their use in biotechnological processes. Cytochromes P450 are highly interesting enzymes for biotechnological purposes because they are able to hydroxylate a broad variety of substrates with high regio- and stereoselectivity. One promising steroid hydroxylating cytochrome P450 for biotechnological applications is CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368. It is one of a few known bacterial cytochromes P450 able to transform steroids such as progesterone and 11-deoxycortisol. CYP106A2 can be easily expressed in Escherichia coli with a high yield and can be reconstituted using the adrenal redox proteins, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. We developed a simple screening assay for this system and performed random mutagenesis of CYP106A2, yielding variants with improved 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone hydroxylation activity. After two generations of directed evolution, we were able to improve the kcat/Km of the 11-deoxycortisol hydroxylation by a factor of more than four. At the same time progesterone conversion was improved about 1.4-fold. Mapping the mutations identified in catalytically improved CYP106A2 variants into the structure of a CYP106A2 model suggests that these mutations influence the mobility of the F/G loop, and the interaction with the redox partner adrenodoxin. The results show the evolution of a soluble steroid hydroxylase as a potential new catalyst for the production of steroidogenic compounds.",0

,"[A study on the regulation of intrauterine milieu by bioactive substances of fetal origin in the human amniotic fluid--the analyses of interactions among amnion, chorion laeve, and decidua vera tissues].","To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of human intrauterine milieu, the effects of various substances on the production of endothelin (ET) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) by amnion cells were investigated. In addition, we examined the regulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity, which has been shown to be involved in the signal transduction in various tissues such as ovary, adrenal gland, etc. The ET production by cultured amnion cells was stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), or interleukin-1 (IL-1). Ligand binding analyses indicated that both ET-A receptor and ET-B receptor are present in chorion laeve, decidua vera, and myometrium, but not in the amnion tissue at term. However, amnion tissue in the second trimester showed a significant amount of binding capacity for ET-1 but not for ET-3, indicating the presence of ET-A receptor in this tissue in the second trimester. These observations were confirmed by Northern blot analyses. In cultured amnion cells, ET-B receptor was detected by Northern blot analysis. The expression of this ET-B receptor in cultured amnion cells was down-regulated by the addition of EGF, but not by ET-1, IL-1 or A23187. Moreover, ET-1 inhibited the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by cultured amnion cells. These results suggest that ET-1 secreted from amnion cells may block prostaglandin synthesis in amnion cells during the second trimester, but this block may be released at term by the action of EGF. The BNP production by cultured amnion cells was dose-dependently stimulated by TGF-beta, but was inhibited by cortisol or EGF. TGF-beta (approximately 400 pM) was detected in the human amniotic fluid by a bioassay. The TGF-beta augmented BNP production was blocked by the simultaneous treatment with cortisol or EGF. The receptor for BNP (particulate guanylate cyclase A-type: GC-A) was identified in chorion, decidua, and myometrium by both cGMP generation assay and Northern blot analysis. However, GC-A was not detected in amnion tissues in the second trimester and at term. In an in vitro experiment with rat pregnant uterus, both BNP and cGMP dose-dependently inhibited the prostaglandin F2 alpha induced uterine contraction. Thus, BNP secreted from amnion cells may not act on amnion tissue, but on the decidua and myometrium, and generate cGMP, the second messenger of BNP, and finally block uterine contraction during the second trimester.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0

Among these, 173 (61.8%) received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including lamivudine (3TC) for 122 children. Detection of the hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) was performed on specimens collected at inclusion and 6 months later. If results of both tests were positive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)/hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) and HBV DNA levels were measured at inclusion and during follow-up. A fourth-generation HCV enzyme immunoassay was used for HCV screening at inclusion.In our pediatric cohort, no patients were infected with HCV, but the prevalence of HBsAg at inclusion was 12.1% (34 of 280; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6-16.6). Among the HBV-HIV-1-coinfected children, a high rate of positive HBeAg chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was noted at inclusion (82.4% [ 28 of 34]; 95% CI, 65.5%-93.2%) and after a median follow-up of 18 months (78.3%; 95% CI, 45.5%-92.7%), with no significant difference between children treated with HAART (with or without 3TC) and untreated ones. These children showed high HBV DNA levels (usually >8.0 log(10) copies/mL) and viral population consisting of nearly exclusively wild-type HBeAg-positive HBV strains, strongly suggesting that most of them were in the initial immunotolerant phase of chronic hepatitis B.In sub-Saharan Africa, children with chronic hepatitis B and who are treated with 3TC-based HAART are at risk of developing 3TC resistance. Further studies are required to guide the management of HBV-HIV-1-coinfected children.",0

Dose-response and activities of detoxication enzymes of the fenvalerate-resistant strain (R-fenvalerate), the imidacloprid-resistant strain (R-imidacloprid), and a susceptible strain (S) were determined. After 16 consecutive generations of selection, resistance of A. gossypii to fenvalerate increased >29,000-fold and to imidacloprid 8.1-fold. On cucumber. resistance of the R-fenvalerate strain to fenvalerate increased 700-fold and to imidacloprid 3.6-fold. However, the most significant finding in this study was that the R-imidacloprid strain exhibited cross-resistance to fenvalerate, with a resistance ratio of 108.9-fold on cotton and 3:3.5-fold on cucumber, whereas the R-fenvalerate strain did not show significant cross-resistance to imidacloprid on either plant species. Both resistant strains of A. gossypii were more resistant to fenvalerate on cotton than on cucumber, whereas their susceptibility to imidacloprid on otton and cucumber were not significantly different. The response of the S strain to fenvalerate and imidacloprid were similar on cotton and Cucumber. Activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and alpha-naphthylacetate (alpha-NA) esterases of A. gossypii were significantly different among the three strains, with the R-fenvalerate strains having the highest, followed by the R-imidacloprid strain, and the S strain the lowest. The activities of the AChE and alpha-NA esterases for all three strains were also significantly higher on cotton than on cucumber. The resistance mechanism and resistance management strategies for the R-fenvalerate and R-imidacloprid strains of A. gossypii to fenvalerate and imidacloprid on cotton and cucumber are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m006032200,Selective Resistance to Parathyroid Hormone Caused by a Novel Uncoupling Mutation in the Carboxyl Terminus of Gαs,"G<sub>s</sub> is a heterotrimeric (α, β, and γ chains) G protein that couples heptahelical plasma membrane receptors to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Inactivation of one <i>GNAS1</i> gene allele encoding the α chain of G<sub>s</sub> (Gα<sub>s</sub>) causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia. Affected subjects have resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other hormones that activate adenylyl cyclase plus somatic features termed Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. By contrast, subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib have hormone resistance that is limited to PTH and lack Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The molecular basis for pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib is unknown. We analyzed the <i>GNAS1</i> gene for mutations using polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic DNA from three brothers with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. We identified a novel heterozygous 3-base pair deletion causing loss of isoleucine 382 in the three affected boys and their clinically unaffected mother and maternal grandfather. This mutation was absent in other family members and 15 additional unrelated subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. To characterize the signaling properties of the mutant Gα<sub>s</sub>, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the isoleucine 382 deletion into a wild type Gα<sub>s</sub> cDNA, transfected HEK293 cells with either wild type or mutant Gα<sub>s</sub> cDNA, plus cDNAs encoding heptahelical receptors for PTH, thyrotropic hormone, or luteinizing hormone, and we measured cAMP production in response to hormone stimulation. The mutant Gα<sub>s</sub> protein was unable to interact with the receptor for PTH but showed normal coupling to the other coexpressed heptahelical receptors. These results provide evidence of selective uncoupling of the mutant Gα<sub>s</sub> from PTH receptors and explain PTH-specific hormone resistance in these three brothers with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. The absence of PTH resistance in the mother and maternal grandfather who carry the same mutation is consistent with current models of paternal imprinting of the <i>GNAS1</i> gene.",0

Experience with Daphnia magna, Chironomus prasinus and Lymnaea peregra","A cost /effective innovative approach combining three freshwater invertebrates: the cladoceran Daphnia magna, the insect Chironomus prasinus and the basommatophoran snail Lymnaea peregra, in a single system is presented. The selection combines different reproductive strategies: parthenogenesis, sexual reproduction and hermaphroditism, respectively, and covers water column, sediment, food and contact exposure. Results confirm the system's capacity. In 46 days, multi-generation, whole-life-cycle, and chronic reproduction assays can be achieved for D. magna, C. prasinus and L. peregra, respectively. The 21-day D. magna test is commonly used to assess the effects of chemicals on aquatic invertebrates. Wide concerns on its suitability for testing endocrine disrupting chemicals have been raised, particularly for substances with estrogenic activities. The combination of three species with different reproductive strategies offer a suitable approach for assessing ecologically relevant effects related to any mechanism of action, including endocrine disruption.",0

Over 6000 COPD patients received cilomilast during an extensive clinical development programme performed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).Five phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pivotal studies were conducted in poorly reversible patients (<15% or <200 mL improvement over baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) after salbutamol). Patients were randomized to receive oral cilomilast 15 mg (n = 2088) or placebo (n = 1408) twice daily for 24 weeks. The co-primary efficacy variables were changes from baseline in trough (predose) FEV(1) and in total score of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Additional studies were performed to investigate the anti-inflammatory actions of cilomilast by measuring inflammatory cells and mediators in biopsies and induced sputum; to assess the long-term effects of cilomilast; to assess the cardiac safety of cilomilast; and to assess the efficacy of cilomilast on hyperinflation. Results from one of the phase III and from one supportive study have been previously published.In the phase III pivotal studies, when averaged over 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in FEV(1) in the cilomilast group showed improvement compared with placebo in all studies (range 24-44 mL treatment difference). When averaged over 24 weeks, there was a similar improvement in the mean total SGRQ score in both treatment groups with a decrease ranging from -1.8 to -4.2 units in the cilomilast group and 0.4 to -4.9 units in the placebo group. Only one study, however, showed both a statistically and clinically meaningful difference between the two treatment groups (treatment difference -4.1 units; p < 0.001). Although cilomilast was shown to reduce COPD exacerbations in some of these studies, there was no effect on the incidence of COPD exacerbations in a study specifically powered to detect a difference compared with placebo.No significant change was found in the primary endpoints of the anti-inflammatory studies, although some anti-inflammatory activity was detected, including a reduction in tissue CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages in airway biopsies. In addition, studies did not demonstrate a consistent significant effect of cilomilast on hyperinflation.In all studies, adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal body system were reported more frequently in the cilomilast group than the placebo group and predominantly occurred within the first 2 weeks of initiating cilomilast therapy.During the cilomilast development programme a number of different endpoints were investigated to characterize the efficacy and safety of this second-generation phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor. Safety assessments throughout the late-phase programme did not reveal any evidence of serious safety concerns with the use of cilomilast. Previous studies in phase II and early phase III had shown improvements in efficacy endpoints and some evidence of an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action. However, subsequent phase III studies failed to definitively confirm the earlier programme results, which led to termination of the development of cilomilast.",0

Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, PsychLit, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from January 1980 through October 2006. Comparative evidence was summarized and indirect comparisons were made using network meta-analysis. Only three head-to-head trials were identified; comparative trials found only minimal differences in efficacy between escitalopram and paroxetine, and no statistically significant differences in efficacy between extended-release venlafaxine and paroxetine. Pooled evidence from 15 placebo-controlled trials suggests that escitalopram [relative benefit (RB) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.5], paroxetine (RB 1.9; 95% CI 1.5-2.3), sertraline (RB 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-2.2), and venlafaxine (RB 1.7; 95% CI 1.5-1.9) all produce significantly more responders than placebo; evidence favored fluvoxamine over placebo but was not significant (RB 1.5; 95% CI 0.9-2.4). Network meta-analysis did not reveal differences in efficacy among drugs. Overall, a fair amount of evidence supports the efficacy of escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine in social anxiety disorder. The drugs do not differ in efficacy, although their adverse event profiles do.",0

The roux plumage sex-linked recessive gene may be used for early sexing of Japanese quail in crossbreeding production systems with wild-type and roux lines. However, associated effects of the gene on carcase and meat composition need to be assessed. 2. Quail carcases from pure Line K males and females (100% K), a heavy meat line which was used as the recipient line for the introgression of the roux gene, and from same-age roux or wild-type females from the second generation of introgression (75% K) were dissected. The effects of sex, line and plumage colour on carcase components and on protein and lipid contents of various tissues were estimated. 3. Expected sex differences in carcase weights were obtained, with marginally higher values for females. However, weights of parts and carcase yield (ratio of empty carcase weight without head, neck and feet over live body weight) were similar for both sexes in pure Line K which had a 68% carcase yield. Lipid contents in leg meat were higher in males (3.1%) than in females (2.7%). 4. The roux gene did not seem to have any major impact on carcase parts or composition. However, in roux birds, leg skin was marginally higher in lipids and pectoralis major lower in proteins than in wild-type ones.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-15379,Right-Sided Shift Found in Metachronous Colorectal Adenomas,"Patients who have had a colorectal adenoma are likely to develop a metachronous adenoma, and therefore need to be kept under surveillance. The question is whether metachronous adenomas will be found at the same anatomical site as the preceding adenomas, thus prompting us to focus surveillance examinations on this region, using flexible sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy.Between 1978 and 1996 a long-term follow up of 1091 patients was prospectively documented at the Erlangen Registry of Colorectal Polyps. The anatomical sites--distal (rectosigmoid) and proximal colon--of two subsequent generations of metachronous adenomas were analysed using logistic regression analysis.In 556 (51%) patients metachronous adenomas were found during follow up. In 211 (37.9%) of these patients a right-sided shift in the first generation of metachronous adenomas in comparison with initial lesions (P<0.0001) was found. Some 305 patients underwent further follow up, and 51 (27.1%) out of 188 patients with metachronous lesions demonstrated a right-sided shift in their second generation (vs. first generation) of metachronous adenomas. Proximally located first generation metachronous adenomas would be missed by flexible sigmoidoscopy in 50.8% of patients with only distal adenomas at baseline colonoscopy, and in 58.7% of patients with second-generation lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that multiplicity (odds ratio 2.64, 95% CI 1.49-4.66) and size of initial adenomas (>5 mm) (odds ratio 3.60, 95% CI 1.96-6.66) were significantly associated with a right-sided shift in metachronous adenomas, while female gender was associated with a significantly lower tendency to manifest a right-sided shift (odds ratio of 0.64. 95% CI 0.43-0.94).Metachronous adenomas are found significantly more often in the right colon than would be expected assuming clustering at the same anatomical site as the preceding lesions. Total colonoscopy is thus needed for surveillance, regardless of the initial adenoma site.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/1447-056x-11-5,Perception of picky eating among children in Singapore and its impact on caregivers: a questionnaire survey,"Picky eating is relatively common among infants and children, often causing anxiety for parents and caregivers. The purpose of this study was to determine the key aspects of picky eating and feeding difficulties among children aged 1 to 10 years in Singapore and the impact on their parents or caregivers.In this survey, 407 parents or grandparents who are the primary caregivers of children aged 1 to 10 years in Singapore were interviewed via telephone using a structured questionnaire of 36 questions. Respondents were randomly selected from the Singapore Residential Telephone Directory to meet a pre-set interlocked quota of race, sex, and age to represent the population. Quantitative data collected included demographics, body weight and height, respondents' perceptions of the duration of picky eating, the child's eating habits and perceived health status, respondents' attitudes towards picky eating, coping strategies and the impact on family relationships. Bonferroni z-test and t-test were used to indicate significance across groups or demographics, while Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of association between variables.One-half of the respondents reported that the child was 'all the time' (25.1%) or sometimes (24.1%) a picky eater. When aided with a list of typical behaviours, the respondent-reported prevalence of picky eating or feeding difficulties occurring 'all the time' increased to 49.6%. The highest number of respondents first noticed the child's picky eating behaviours or feeding difficulties as early as 1 year (20.0%). Children 3 to 10 years [p = 0.022], children of professional respondents (p = 0.019), and children with a family history of picky eating (p = 0.03) were significantly more likely to be picky eaters. Overall, all 'picky eating' and all 'feeding difficulty' behaviours occurring 'all the time' were significantly associated with caregiver stress when feeding (p = 0.000026 and p = 0.000055, respectively) and with a negative impact on family relationships (p = 0.011 and p = 0.00000012, respectively).The perceived prevalence and duration of picky eating behaviours and feeding difficulties are high. The impact on the respondent and family relationships appears to be significant in Singapore. Parental concerns about picky eating should be adequately assessed and managed in routine clinic consultations.",0

The original animals were captured using Sherman's live traps and transferred into wooden cages. After several generations they were housed in plastic cages. Their diet consisted of trout pellets, cat food, and water provided ad libitum. Monogamous pairs were housed together for 2-3 weeks for mating, and the male was separated from the female during delivery and nursing. In captivity, the reproductive activity was observed throughout the year and the gestation period was estimated at 28-30 days with a litter size of between 1 and 4 pups. Pups grew very rapidly, and reached adult body size (mean: male, 9.7 g; female, 8.3 g) and sexual maturation at 6-8 weeks of age. The reproductive life was estimated at one and a half years, while the longevity was approximately 2 years.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-34-3-335,Use of maternal information for QTL detection in a (grand)daughter design,"In a (grand)daughter design, maternal information is often neglected because the number of progeny per dam is limited. The number of dams per maternal grandsire (MGS), however, could be large enough to contribute to QTL detection. But dams and MGS usually are not genotyped, there are two recombination opportunities between the MGS and the progeny, and at a given location, only half the progeny receive a MGS chromosomal segment. A 3-step procedure was developed to estimate: (1) the marker phenotypes probabilities of the MGS; (2) the probability of each possible MGS haplotype; (3) the probabilities that the progeny receives either the first, or second MGS segment, or a maternal grandam segment. These probabilities were used for QTL detection in a linear model including the effects of sire, MGS, paternal QTL, MGS QTL and maternal grandam QTL. Including the grandam QTL effect makes it possible to detect QTL in the grandam population, even when MGS are not informative. The detection power, studied by simulation, was rather high, provided that MGS family size was greater than 50. Using maternal information in the French dairy cattle granddaughter design made it possible to detect 23 additional QTL genomewise significant.",0
,The use of resin-based composite restorations in pulpotomized primary molars.,"The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to report a 12- to 54-month follow-up, in which a resin-based composite filling material was used in direct contact with a fast-setting zinc oxide eugenol cement to restore the function and anatomy of 51 pulpotomized primary molars in 2- to 11-year-old children who needed a Class I or II restoration. Formocresol pulpotomy using Temrex cement was performed in all cases. The total-etch technique was used with: (1) 35% phosphoric acid; (2) OptiBond Solo Plus bonding agent; and (3) Filtek P60/shade B2 resin-based composite material. The restored teeth were sealed with Embrace pit and fissure sealant, monitored, and evaluated with periodic radiographs and clinical exams at 6-month recall visits. The results revealed that none of the 51 pulpotomized primary molars had evidence of periapical or furcation pathosis, recurrent decay, open margins, or broken restorations. In conclusion, this clinical study demonstrated that resin-based composite restorations--combined with the total-etch technique and a fifth-generation bonding agent and in direct contact with a fast-setting zinc oxide eugenol cement were long-lasting, quality clinical alternatives to restore the anatomy and function of pulpotomized primary molars.",0

Calcium ions play a role in the initial and chronic development of atherosclerotic lesions. Several studies in experimental animal models have demonstrated the potential direct antiatherosclerotic effects of calcium antagonists. In this study the antiatherogenic activity of lercanidipine, a new lipophilic, second-generation calcium antagonist, was investigated. Lercanidipine and its enantiomers inhibited the replication and migration of arterial myocytes in concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 microM. The antiproliferative effect of lercanidipine was dose dependent, with a potency similar to that of lacidipine and nifedipine, and was unrelated to the stereoselectivity of enantiomers to bind L-type calcium channels. Lercanidipine and its enantiomers (25 microM) decreased the serum-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in SMC, with the (S)-enantiomer (69% inhibition) being 2.4-fold more active than the (R)-counterpart (29% inhibition). The studies performed with enantiomers of lercanidipine suggest that the observed effects are not related to the blockade of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and confirm, at least in vitro, the pharmacological potential of the compound to influence negatively the process of atherogenesis.",0

This study investigates whether co-administration with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole, which have little propensity to induce weight gain, can attenuate the hyperphagic effect of olanzapine. Female hooded-Lister rats ( n = 8 per group) were treated acutely with either vehicle, olanzapine (1 mg/kg), ziprasidone (1 mg/kg), aripiprazole (2 mg/kg) or olanzapine in combination with ziprasidone or aripiprazole and placed in automated locomotor activity (LMA) boxes with preweighed palatable mash. Food intake and LMA were measured for 60 min postdrug treatment. All olanzapine-treated groups demonstrated significant increases in food intake ( P &lt; 0.001). This effect was attenuated following co-administration of olanzapine with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole ( P &lt; 0.001), neither of which affected food intake alone. The lack of hyperphagia induced by aripiprazole and ziprasidone may reflect an inherent pharmacological mechanism preventing weight gain.",0

The first generation antipsychotics could establish the possibility of managing many psychotic subjects in an outpatient setting. With the advent of the second (SGA) and third generation antipsychotics (TGA), other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar depression, bipolar mania, autism, and major depressive disorder have now been approved for the use of these drugs for their treatment. Also, the administration of more specific assessment tools has allowed for better delineation of the repercussions of these drugs on symptoms and the quality of life of patients who use antipsychotic agents. In general, the SGA share similar mechanisms of action to achieve these results: dopamine-2 receptor antagonism plus serotonin-2A receptor antagonism. The TGA (eg, aripiprazole) have partial agonist activity at the dopamine-2 receptor site, and are also called dopaminergic stabilizers. The pharmacological profile of SGA and TGA may provide better efficacy against negative symptoms, and are less likely to produce extrapyramidal symptoms; however, the SGA and TGA are associated with many other adverse events. The clinician has to balance the risks and benefits of these medications when choosing an antipsychotic for an individual patient.Keywords: antipsychotic agents, schizophrenia, pharmacology, safety",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.08.019,Odor-mediated aggregation enhances the colonization ability of Drosophila melanogaster,"Animal aggregation is a general phenomenon in ecological systems. Aggregations are generally considered as an evolutionary advantageous state in which members derive the benefits of mate choice and protection against natural enemies, balanced by the costs of limiting resources and intraspecific competition. Many insects use chemical information to find conspecifics and to form aggregations. In this study, we describe a spatio-temporal simulation model designed to explore and quantify the effects of the strength of chemical attraction, on the colonization ability of a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) population. We found that the use of infochemicals is crucial for colonizing an area. Fruit flies subject to an Allee effect that are unable to respond to chemical information could not successfully colonize the area and went extinct within four generations. This was mainly caused by very high mortality due to the Allee effect. Even when the Allee effect did not play a role, the random dispersing population had more difficulties in colonizing the area and is doomed to extinction in the long run. When fruit flies had the ability to respond to chemical information, they successfully colonized the orchard. This happened faster, for stronger attraction to chemical information. In addition, more fruit flies were able to find the resources and the settlement on the resources was much higher. This resulted in a reduced mortality due to the Allee effect for fruit flies able to respond to chemical information. Odor-mediated aggregation thus enhances the colonization ability of D. melanogaster . Even a weak attraction to chemical information paved the way to successfully colonize the orchard.",0
https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.18.664,"Effect of a High .ALPHA.-Linolenate and High Linoleate Diet on Membrane-Associated Enzyme Activities in Rat Brain - Modulation of Na+,K+-ATPase Activity at Suboptimal Concentrations of ATP.","Semi-purified diets supplemented with either a high alpha-linolenate (n - 3) (perilla) oil or a high linoleate (n - 6) (safflower) oil were fed to rats through two generations. Rats fed safflower oil showed a decrease in docosahexaenoic acid (n - 3) and a compensatory increase in docosapentaenoic acid (n - 6) in all the brain regions and organelles examined, when compared with rats fed perilla oil. As reported previously, the safflower oil-fed rats exhibited inferior learning ability compared with the perilla oil-fed rats (N. Yamamoto et al., J. Lipid Res. 28, 144 (1987)). Using brains of rats in these dietary groups, the activities of several enzymes, Na+ , K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, 5'-nucleotidase, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, acetylcholinesterase, and choline acetyltransferase in membranes, were compared. The 5'-nucleotidase activity in cortex and hippocampus, and the Na+, K+-ATPase activity in myelin decreased slightly but significantly in the safflower oil group. None of the other membrane-associated enzyme activities in all the brain regions and organelles examined was affected significantly by the dietary fatty acids under optimal assay conditions in vitro. However, in the safflower oil group, the Na+, K+-ATPase activity of synaptosomes at a suboptimal concentration of ATP was 78% that in the perilla oil group. These results suggest that relatively large changes in the proportions of n - 3 and n - 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain membranes caused by dietary manipulation do not provoke significant alterations in most membrane-bound enzyme activities. However, a small but significant change in Na+, K+-ATPase activity at a suboptimal concentration of ATP may be implicated in the altered learning behavior reported earlier.",0

Such genetically based and heritable resistance contribute to the persistence of populations in contaminated areas. Here we report on molecular responses to experimental copper in populations of the earthworm, Dendrobaena octaedra, originating from copper contaminated soil near Gusum (Sweden) where heavy metal pollution has been present for several decades. We studied gene expression of six genes potentially involved in resistance to copper toxicity using F2-generations of D. octaedra populations, originating from reference sites and contaminated (High, Medium and Low) sites around Gusum. The main result was different expression patterns of genes encoding for two different isoforms (mt1 and mt2) of metallothionein proteins during experimental exposure to copper contaminated soil. Expression of mt1 showed a fast and significant upregulation in the High population and a slower, albeit significant, upregulation in Medium and Low populations. However, in the three reference populations no upregulation were seen. In comparison, a fast upregulation was also seen for the High population in the isoform mt2, whereas, gene expression of all other populations, including reference populations, showed slower upregulation in response to experimental copper. The results indicate that copper resistance in D. octaedra from contaminated areas is related to an increased expression of metallothioneins.",1

The study tested how far group differences in individual change in adjustment over time were explained by differences in exposure to specific environmental risk experiences. Data are drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Information on mothers' own experience of childhood abuse, offspring adjustment at ages 4 and 7 years, and hypothesized mediators was available for 5,619 families. A residuals scores analysis was used to track children's adjustment over time. Maternal childhood abuse was associated with poorer behavioral trajectories between ages 4 and 7 years. Children of abused mothers were more likely to experience a range of negative life events between ages 4 and 7 years, including changes in family composition, separations from parents, ""shocks and frights"" and physical assaults. Interim life events, together with antecedent psychosocial risk (maternal antenatal affective symptoms, age 4 parental hostility, age 4 family type) fully mediated the association between maternal childhood abuse and offspring prognosis.The authors express their gratitude to the families who participated in the study. Support for these analyses was provided by a grant from the Medical Research Council. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is part of the World Health Organisation initiated European Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, and is supported, among others, by the Wellcome Trust, The Department of Health, The Department of the Environment, and the Medical Research Council. The ALSPAC study team comprises interviewers, computer technicians, laboratory technicians, clerical workers, research scientists, volunteers, and managers who continue to make the study possible.",0
,[Clinical genetics for hereditary cancers: from the viewpoint of physicians working at a hospital specialized in cancer].,"In our daily practice, we provide clinical genetic consultation for patients at risk for hereditary cancers. The clinical characteristics of hereditary cancer syndromes in adults differ from those of hereditary diseases in children, although both involve genetic disease. One major difference is the difficulty in diagnosing hereditary cancers. Genetic testing has enabled us to diagnose HNPCC and familial breast and ovarian cancers. Another difference is the possibility to improve the outcomes of hereditary cancer syndromes by medical intervention. Intentional surveillance thus plays a key role in the management of hereditary cancer syndromes. These features make genetic counseling essential for hereditary cancer syndromes, including genetic testing and lifelong disease management. Networking among genetic disease specialists is particularly necessary. Clinical geneticists should be responsible for not only genetic disease but also for genomic information about cancer, with the ultimate goal of providing ""order-made"" medical consultation and services. Another important goal is the establishment of systems for the comprehensive care of patients and for the career development of specialists to provide regional-based care for persons who have or are at risk for hereditary cancers, including future generations.",0

One of reasons for the lack of definite approximate PTH values is the inability to use the Allegro Intact PTH assay from Nicols. We aimed to evaluate whether other parathyroid hormone assays were suitable for these assessments. We compared the parathyroid hormone concentrations measured with five commercial immunoassays by using three serum pools and seven artificially spiked samples of parathyroid hormone; the Total Intact parathyroid hormone assay was used as the reference assay. Although the results of parathyroid hormone assays showed high correlation, the concentrations differed from Yamasa's assay to another. And the third/second-generation assay ratio was approximately 60%. Further, the Immulite assay overestimated the levels of 1–84 PTH. We showed important inter-method variations in the parathyroid hormone assays used in Japan.",0
,Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation addressing focal chondral defect in adolescent knee.,"Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) is the third generation tissue-engineering technique for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects. The aim of this study was to describe this new technique and the postoperative findings in adolescent knee with focal chondral defect.The MACI consists of diagnostic arthroscopy and cartilage harvest, chondrocyte culture and seeding in tissue-engineering collagenous membrane, and implantation of the scaffold. Clinical outcome at minimum 1-year follow-up was assessed in seven patients (mean age (16.6 ± 1.5) years; 14 - 19 years) with full-thickness cartilage defects, with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Besides, MR imaging was performed with T1 and T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled (3D-SPGR) MR imaging.Clinical evaluation showed significant improvement and MRI analysis showed that the structure was homogeneous and the implant surface was regular and intact in six patients, but irregular in one. Of all the seven patients, the cartilage defect site was nearly totally covered by the implanted scaffold.These results indicated that MACI technique is an option for cartilage defect in adolescent knee joint, especially large defect of over 2 cm(2). Long-term assessment is necessary to determine the true value of this technique.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/49.2.367,Exposure to co-amoxiclav as a risk factor for co-amoxiclav-resistant Escherichia coli urinary tract infection,"The objective of the study was to define whether individual exposure to co-amoxiclav is a risk factor for selecting co-amoxiclav-resistant Escherichia coli in vivo. One hundred and eight patients were included in our study as soon as they were found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) due to E. coli. Stool probes were also undertaken for some of these patients. Co-amoxiclav administration in the month before diagnosing the UTI, and any treatment to cure the current UTI were recorded for all patients. When co-amoxiclav-resistant E. coli was detected in the stools after diagnosis of E. coli UTI, isolates were compared with urinary E. coli isolates in terms of clonal relatedness, beta-lactam susceptibility and mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance. The patients who had taken co-amoxiclav in the month before the reported E. coli UTI had a significantly higher risk of being infected with co-amoxiclav-resistant E. coli. Those patients treated with amoxicillin for a current infection were at greater risk of intestinal carriage of co-amoxiclav-resistant E. coli; those treated with co-amoxiclav had a greater risk of intestinal carriage of co-amoxiclav-resistant Gram-negative bacilli than patients treated with third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Hence, individual exposure to co-amoxiclav is a risk factor for UTIs caused by co-amoxiclav-resistant E. coli or for carrying co-amoxiclav-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in the digestive tract.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/11204490-000000000-00000,Levetiracetam: a review of its use in epilepsy.,"Levetiracetam (Keppra®, E Keppra®) is an established second-generation antiepileptic drug (AED). Worldwide, levetiracetam is most commonly approved as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization; other approved indications include monotherapy treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization, and adjunctive treatment of myoclonic seizures associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and primary generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam has a novel structure and unique mechanisms of action. Unlike other AEDs, the mechanisms of action of levetiracetam appear to involve neuronal binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A, inhibiting calcium release from intraneuronal stores, opposing the activity of negative modulators of GABA- and glycin-gated currents and inhibiting excessive synchronized activity between neurons. In addition, levetiracetam inhibits N-type calcium channels. Levetiracetam is associated with rapid and complete absorption, high oral bioavailability, minimal metabolism that consists of hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and primarily renal elimination. It lacks cytochrome P450 isoenzyme-inducing potential and is not associated with clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs, including other AEDs. The efficacy of oral immediate-release levetiracetam in controlling seizures has been established in numerous randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trials in patients with epilepsy. Adjunctive levetiracetam reduced the frequency of seizures in paediatric and adult patients with refractory partial onset seizures to a significantly greater extent than placebo. Monotherapy with levetiracetam was noninferior to that with carbamazepine controlled release in controlling seizures in patients with newly diagnosed partial onset seizures. Levetiracetam also provided seizure control relative to placebo as adjunctive therapy in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic seizures or GTC seizures. In addition, patients receiving oral levetiracetam showed improvements in measures of health-related quality of life relative to those receiving placebo. Although treatment-emergent adverse events were commonly reported in the clinical trials of levetiracetam, the overall proportion of patients who experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was broadly similar in the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups, with most events being mild to moderate in severity. Levetiracetam is not associated with cognitive impairment or drug-induced weight gain, but has been associated with behavioural adverse effects in some patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2008.03952.x,Landscape genetic structure of coastal tailed frogs (<i>Ascaphus truei</i>) in protected vs. managed forests,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are the leading causes of species’ declines and extinctions. A key component of studying population response to habitat alteration is to understand how fragmentation affects population connectivity in disturbed landscapes. We used landscape genetic analyses to determine how habitat fragmentation due to timber harvest affects genetic population connectivity of the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), a forest-dwelling, stream-breeding amphibian. We compared rates of gene flow across old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest, although this was likely a historical signature of continuous forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations. Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.09.020,Genetic Overlap Among Intelligence and Other Candidate Endophenotypes for Schizophrenia,"A strategy to improve genetic studies of schizophrenia involves the use of endophenotypes. Information on overlapping genetic contributions among endophenotypes may provide additional power, reveal biological pathways, and have practical implications for genetic research. Several cognitive endophenotypes, including intelligence, are likely to be modulated by overlapping genetic influences.We quantified potential genetic and environmental correlations among endophenotypes for schizophrenia, including sensorimotor gating, openness, verbal fluency, early visual perception, spatial working memory, and intelligence, using variance component models in 35 patients and 145 relatives from 25 multigenerational Dutch families multiply affected with schizophrenia.Significant correlations were found between spatial working memory and intelligence (.45), verbal fluency and intelligence (.36), verbal fluency and spatial working memory (.20), and early visual perception and spatial working memory (.19). A strong genetic correlation (.75) accounted for 76% of the variance shared between spatial working memory and intelligence. Significant environmental correlations were found between verbal fluency and openness (.50) and between verbal fluency and spatial working memory (.58). Sensorimotor gating and openness showed few genetic or environmental correlations with other endophenotypes.Our results suggest that intelligence strongly overlaps genetically with a known cognitive endophenotype for schizophrenia. Intelligence may thus be a promising endophenotype for genetic research in schizophrenia, even though the underlying genetic mechanism may still be complex. In contrast, sensorimotor gating and openness appear to represent separate genetic entities with simpler inheritance patterns and may therefore augment the detection of separate genetic pathways contributing to schizophrenia.",0

H12-PEG-polyAlb was administered intravenously into thrombocytopenic rats and the t((1/2)) of the particles and the tail bleeding time were measured to evaluate the prolongation in the hemostatic effect.H12-PEG-polyAlb particles modified with PEG prolonged the t((1/2)) and maintained specific binding ability to activated PLTs. The particles dose dependently shortened the tail bleeding time of thrombocytopenic rats 6 hours after injection.H12-PEG-polyAlb may be a suitable candidate for treatment of bleeding into thrombocytopenic patients as an alternative to PLT concentrate transfusion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.02.064,The Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase Fe protein gene (nifH) functionally substitutes for the chlL gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"The entire coding region of chlL, an essential chloroplast gene required for chlorophyll biosynthesis in the dark in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, was precisely replaced by either the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH (encoding the structural component of nitrogenase Fe protein) or the Escherichia coli uidA reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. Homoplasmic nifH or uidA transformants were identified by Southern blots after selection on minimal medium plates for several generations. All the uidA transformants had the ""yellow-in-the-dark"" phenotype characteristic of chlL mutants, whereas homoplasmic nifH transformants exhibited a partial ""green-in-the-dark"" phenotype. NifH protein was detected in the nifH transformants but not in the wild-type strain by Western blotting. Fluorescence emission measurements also showed the existence of chlorophyll in the dark-grown nifH transformants, but not in the dark-grown uidA transformants. The nifH transplastomic form of C. reinhardtii that lacks the chlL gene can still produce chlorophyll in the dark, suggesting that the nifH product can at least partially substitute for the function of the putative ""chlorophyll iron protein"" encoded by chlL. Thus, introducing nitrogen fixation gene directly into a chloroplast genome is likely to be feasible and providing a possible way of engineering chloroplasts with functional nitrogenase. Notably, to introduce foreign genes without also introducing selective marker genes, a novel two-step chloroplast transformation strategy has been developed.",0

Preliminary clinical trials are encouraging. Bazedoxifene has been found to be efficacious in reducing bone turnover without adverse effects of breast pain. In Phase III studies, bazedoxifene was found to increase vasomotor symptoms when compared with placebo. This effect is similar to that of raloxifene. Lack of endometrial stimulation is another advantage. Current literature suggests that bazedoxifene is likely to be safe, well tolerated and effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, completion of Phase III clinical trials will further elucidate its safety and efficacy, as well as its advantages in comparison with other selective estrogen-receptor modulators.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910530428,Generation of cytotoxic antibodies to the B16 murine melanoma using a formalinized vaccine,"The goal of our experiments was to determine the extent to which the humoral response to a melanoma vaccine elicits the production of cytotoxic antibodies in tumor-challenged mice. Mice were immunized with a vaccine produced from formalinized extracellular antigens (FECA) derived from B 16 F 10 melanomas. The production of antibodies that recognized the vaccine preparation was determined by ELISA, as was their cross-reactivity with the B700 melanoma,antigen. The antibodies were shown to be anti-proliferative by inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation into the DNA of cultured target cells and cytotoxic by assays for complement-mediated and antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that-60% of the target cells specifically bound antibody from the immune sera. These results confirm that B700 is a significant antigenic component of the FECA vaccine, and provide encouragement for this approach to developing useful melanoma vaccines.",0
,[Grandparents: their experience of the relationship with the oldest grand-child and their psychological well-being].,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the satisfaction with, perceived responsibilities in, and the meaning of the relationship with the oldest grandchild, on the one hand, and the level of psychological well-being measured with the six-dimensional scale of Ryff, on the other hand. Questionnaires came from 255 Flemish retired grandparents with a mean age of 64.6 years. The relationship with the oldest grandchild was generally experienced as positive. Nearly all the grandparents agreed with items about satisfaction drawn from the relationship with the grandchild, about feeling responsible for helping him or her and about experiencing oneself as a valued elder. In general, grandparents reported well-being on all six dimensions. The experience of the relationship with the grandchild was found to be a unique additional predictor of well-being, even when background variables as grandparent's age, subjective health, financial situation and marital status were first brought into the step-wise regression-analyses. These variables explained 5 to 8% of the variance in the dimensions of well-being and 7% of the variance in the total well-being. The experience of the relationship with the oldest grandchild explained an additional 6 to 7% of the variance.",0

Aims To review the available evidence concerning SGA long-acting injections (LAIs). Method A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. Results Risperidone long-acting injection was the first licensed SGA–LAI compound and is effective in the long-term management of schizophrenia, with a safety profile similar to that of oral risperidone. Olanzapine pamoate has recently been approved in Europe. In terms of efficacy, at injection intervals of up to 4 weeks it appears comparable to oral olanzapine, although the potential for ‘post-injection syndrome’ (delirium) calls for additional safety considerations. Paliperidone palmitate is currently under review with the licensing authorities. It also affords the potential advantage of monthly dosing. Conclusions More long-term comparisons of SGA–LAIs with oral SGAs as well as with first-generation antipsychotic LAIs are needed. These studies should include cost-effectiveness data.",0

Most studies show a significant correlation between anti-HCV-seropositivity and the number of blood transfusions or the duration of dialysis respectively. However, even in patients who have not received a blood transfusion the prevalence of HCV infection was significantly higher than in controls. We studied 58 patients on regular haemodialysis using a second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA II) followed by a second-generation recombinant immunosorbent assay (RIBA II) for HCV. For all antibody-positive or indeterminate patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was done using both whole blood and dialysed ultrafiltrate. We were able to show by PCR that no HCV RNA (cells or cell particles) passed through the dialysis membranes.",0

The current study assessed whether this anxiety-related phenotype observed in rats neonatally exposed to LPS is transferable to subsequent generations. Wistar rats were exposed to LPS (0.05 mg/kg, Salmonella enteritidis) or non-pyrogenic saline (equivolume) on postnatal days 3 and 5. In adulthood, animals were subjected to restraint and isolation stress or no stress, and subsequently evaluated for anxiety-like behaviours on the elevated plus maze, acoustic startle response, and holeboard apparatus. Blood was collected to examine corticosterone responses to stress and behavioural testing in adulthood. Animals from both treatment groups which exhibited the anxiety-like phenotype were bred with untreated partners. Maternal care of the second generation (F2) was monitored over the first week of life. In adulthood, the F2 generation underwent identical testing procedures as the parental (F1) generation. The F2 offspring of females exposed to LPS as neonates exhibited an anxiety-like phenotype in adulthood and a potentiated corticosterone response to stress (p<.05). F2 offspring of males exposed to LPS as neonates also exhibited an anxiety-like phenotype (p<.05), however, no differences in corticosterone responses were observed. To determine the impact of maternal care on the anxiety-like phenotype, a cross-fostering study was conducted in which offspring of LPS-treated females were fostered to saline-treated mothers and vice versa, which was found to reverse the behavioural and endocrine phenotypes of the F2 generation. These data indicate that a neonatally bacterially induced anxiety phenotype is transferable across generations in both sexes. Maternal care is the mediating mechanism along the maternal line. We suggest that transmission may be dependent upon heritable epigenetic phenomena for the paternal line. The implications of this study apply to potential neuroimmune pathways through which psychopathology may be transmitted along filial lines.",1
https://doi.org/10.2190/fhjw-d447-y5wl-2m98,Effects of Bereavement/Loss and Pre-Event Status on Subsequent Physical Health in Older Adults,"Males and females aged fifty-five and older were interviewed before and after three types of bereavement/loss: attachment bereavement (child, spouse, parent), nonattachment bereavement (sibling, grandchild, close friend), and other losses (nonbereavements). Five measures of health were used. Before pre-event health was accounted for on self-report measures of health status and medical conditions, pre-event measures of environmental factors and impact measures of bereavement/loss events had significant but modest effects on post-event health. However, after pre-event health was taken into account, the effects of bereavement and other losses were pale in comparison. Bereavement/loss events were not related to subsequent deaths, health events, or the use of medical services. Environmental factors were modestly predictive of nonattachment bereavements and other losses. An unexpected finding was that other losses had stronger effects on health than bereavements. Trend analysis over eighteen months showed a modest decline in health status immediately after a loss event, followed by an improvement in health. In general, this older adult sample handled bereavements and other losses with minimal morbidity and mortality.",0

Five acetabular components were revised for aseptic loosening, recurrent dislocation, or displacement of the polyethylene liner from the metal shell. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up was 84 points. A pre-coated femoral component with a second-generation cementing technique provides good clinical function and survival in the medium term.",0

Clinical interest has come to center on the third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), including letrozole, for such neoadjuvant endocrine treatment. This usually lasts 3-4 months and has been extended to up to 12 months, but optimal treatment duration has not been fully established.This study was designed as a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, exploratory phase IIb/III clinical trial of letrozole 2.5 mg, one tablet daily, for 4-8 months. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of neoadjuvant treatment duration on tumor regression and BCS eligibility to identify optimal treatment duration. Tumor regression (by clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasound), shift towards BCS eligibility, and safety assessments were the main outcome measures. Standard parametric and nonparametric descriptive statistics were performed.Letrozole treatment was received by 32 of the enrolled 33 postmenopausal women (median (range): 67.0 (56-85) years) with unilateral, initially BCS-ineligible primary breast cancer (clinical stage > or = T2, N0, M0). Letrozole treatment duration in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT; required 4 months' letrozole treatment) analysis population (29 patients) was 4 months in 14 patients and > 4 months in 15 patients. The respective per-protocol (PP) subgroup sizes were 14 and 11. The majority of partial or complete responses were observed at 4 months, though some beneficial responses occurred during prolonged letrozole treatment. Compared with baseline, median tumor size in the ITT population was reduced by 62.5% at Month 4 and by 70.0% at final study visit (Individual End). Similarly, in the PP population, respective reductions were 64.0% and 67.0%. Whereas initially all patients were mastectomy candidates, letrozole treatment enabled BCS (lumpectomy) in 22 ITT (75.9%) and 18 PP (72.0%) patients.Over half of patients become BCS-eligible within 4 months of preoperative letrozole treatment. While prolonged treatment for up to 8 months can result in further tumor volume reduction in some patients, there is no clear optimum for treatment duration. Letrozole has a favorable overall safety and tolerability profile.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00535418.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00702854,Cell cycle studies in chorionic villi,"We have studied the cell cycle of cells obtained from chorionic villi in direct and culture preparations by incorporation of the thymidine analogue BrdU to produce latelabelling or sister chromatid differentiation patterns. We have, therefore, been able to estimate the duration of the cell cycle and, more specifically, the length of some of its phases. While results for chorionic villus sample cells in culture resembled those obtained for fibroblasts, data for the spontaneously dividing trophoblastic cells in direct preparations were different. Villi exposed to BrdU immediately after sampling showed a slight delay in the incorporation of the analogue and a lower percentage of labelled cells compared to villi treated after an overnight incubation, probably due to a temporary effect of the sampling technique. Results from semi-direct protocols suggest that cells have a G2 of no more than 4h, and a mid-S phase of 10–16h. The G1 period is very variable. After 48 h incubation with BrdU, only 4% of cells reach their second generation, whereas this percentage increases up to 70% after 72h, indicating that under these experimental conditions most cells have a cell cycle of approximately 36 h. The average number of sister chromatid exchanges was similar in both direct preparations and cultures: 5.2±2.1 SCE per cell.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-011-1101-y,Epigenetics DNA methylation in the core ataxin-2 gene promoter: novel physiological and pathological implications,"Pathogenic CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) expansions beyond certain thresholds in the ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and were shown to contribute to Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Regulation of ATXN2 gene expression and the function of the protein product are not known. SCA2 exhibits an inverse correlation between the size of the CAG repeat and the age at disease onset. However, a wide range of age at onset are typically observed, with CAG repeat number alone explaining only partly this variability. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that ATXN2 levels could be controlled by DNA methylation and that the derangement of this control may lead to escalation of disease severity and influencing the age at onset. We found that CpG methylation in human ATXN2 gene promoter is associated with pathogenic CAG expansions in SCA2 patients. Different levels of methylation in a SCA2 pedigree without an intergenerational CAG repeat instability caused the disease anticipation in a SCA2 family. DNA methylation also influenced the disease onset in SCA2 homozygotes and SCA3 patients. In conclusion, our study points to a novel regulatory mechanism of ATXN2 expression involving an epigenetic event resulting in differential disease course in SCA2 patients.",0
,"Age-developmental stage and severity of trauma related symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms in participants who lost their fathers during the war in Croatia","Children of different ages will experience a traumatic event in a different ways. The most important in the generalization of research findings is recognizing that children of different ages think differently, act differently and have different emotional functioning. Experiences that are extremely traumatic to an adult may be perceived by a young child as something that is not so frightening. The fear that the child feels will more frequently be a reflection of that of the adult rather than generated by the child's own perception of the event. So, the individual experience of the trauma is age dependent. Our study focused on children who lost their fathers in conditions of war The aim was to explore the association between age-developmental stages and the severity of trauma related symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms in participants who lost their fathers during the war. The study included 103 people who lost their fathers during the war in Croatia, who came to the physical and psychiatric examination organized by the Ministry of Family, War Veterans and Intergenerational Solidarity. The sample was consisted of the participants who were children, or not born yet, at the time when they lost their fathers during the war in Croatia. At the time of interview, the participants were aged between 15 and 35 years old. Data was collected using a structured clinical interview which also included socio-demographic data. Data about former and current psychiatric symptoms were collected using the following instruments: Clinician- Administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). Results showed that there was significant correlation between age and results on used scales. The participants who lost their fathers at a very young age or even before they were born showed less trauma symptoms (r=0.249; p < 0.05) less anxiety (r=0.374; p < 0.01) and depressive (r=0.384; p<0.01) symptoms than participants who lost their fathers at an older age. The study confirmed that the individual experience of the trauma of losing a father in war circumstances is associated with age.",0

,Musca domestica L D.,"Field strains of the house fly (Musca domestica L. Diptera: Muscidae) were collected in April and September 2002 from cow farms (Antalya, Izmir) and garbage dumps (Adana, Ankara, Istanbul, Sanliurfa) in Turkey. The resistance levels of first to fifth generation offspring were evaluated against six insecticides (cypermethrin, cyphenothrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, resmethrin, fenitrothion). Resistance levels for pyrethroid group insecticides ranged from 23.27 (permethrin-Istanbul fall strain) to 633.09 (cypermethrin-Izmir spring strain) and for fenitrothion ranged from 5.78 (Istanbul fall strain) to 51.04 (Antalya spring strain). Our results showed that pyrethroid resistance was high and changed from spring to fall in relation to usage and application frequencies of these compounds at the study sites. Although fenitrothion resistance levels were determined to be lower than pyrethroids, these levels were still high and led to control failure. Flies from cow farms were more resistant than those from garbage dumps, but resistance levels for Sanliurfa and Adana strains were also high in relation to usage of different insecticides for agricultural purposes. Although resistance levels against different pyrethroids decreased from spring to fall, these levels still indicated the presence of a strong selective pressure on the populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb04250.x,The Pathophysiology of Ocular Allergy: Current Thinking,"Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the only ocular disease to involve solely Type-1 hypersensitivity, the other main forms of ocular allergy--perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis--each having a more complex immunological basis and a chronic inflammatory component. Involvement of secondary inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, in addition to the mast cells resident in the conjunctival substantia propria, can lead to more serious corneal damage with vision-threatening potential. Thoughtful management of allergic conjunctivitis is needed in order to control the ocular inflammation without incurring steroid-induced side-effects, and patient education is also an important factor in maintaining optimal allergen avoidance, especially in the more severe and chronic cases. Laboratory models can be helpful in assessing the potential of new drugs, and SWR mice (topically sensitised and challenged with short ragweed) show clinical signs of allergic conjunctivitis, together with mast cell and eosinophil involvement, remarkably similar to the human pathophysiology. The antiinflammatory activity of both steroids and nedocromil sodium observed in this animal model supports therapeutic evidence of the usefulness of second-generation mast cell stabilising drugs in the treatment of ocular allergy.",0

The epitope was recently identified and characterized by the human monoclonal IgG antibody Ul/F10 [23] and is located within the amino acid residues 34–39 of the aminoterminal core region. The blood donor sera were selected from anti-HCV ELISA (Ortho, 2nd generation)-reactive samples. Sixty-seven of these sera were further reactive in RIBA (Ortho, 2nd generation). According to their RIBA pattern, these samples were divided into four groups. Samples in the first group (n=18) reacted to all four recombinant HCV antigens. The samples of the second (n=9) and third group (n=8) reacted to c223/c33c and c22-3/cl00-3, respectively. Sera from group 4 (n=32) showed a RIBA indeterminate pattern with reactivity only to c22-3. All 223 samples were analyzed for anti-C34–39 antibodies by ELISA, and the 67 RIBA-reactive samples were additionally tested for the presence of HCV RNA by RT/PCR. In groups 1 and 2, over 80% of the samples showed anti-C34–39 reactivity which was restricted to the IgG1 isotype. In contrast, in groups 3 and 4, antibodies to the epitope C34–39 were detected in less than 10% of the samples. Interestingly, the anti-C34–39 response correlates with the presence of HCV RNA; 95.5% of the samples had coincident results in all subgroups. None of the RIBA-negative sera showed a specific seroreaction to the C34–39 peptide.",0

The primordial germ cells, embryo, and fetus are highly susceptible to epigenetic dysregulation by environmental chemicals, which can thereby exert multiple adverse effects. The data reviewed here on environmental contaminants have potential implications for risk assessment although more data are needed on individual susceptibility to epigenetic alterations and their persistence before this information can be used in formal risk assessments. The findings discussed indicate that identification of environmental chemicals that dysregulate the prenatal epigenome should be a priority in health research and disease prevention.",1

Four fracture patterns were studied (transverse subtrochanteric, subtrochanteric with posteromedial wedge comminution, subtrochanteric with one-centimeter gap, and a one-centimeter gap with a subcapital neck fracture). Single-and double-leg stance loading was simulated using a servohydraulic load frame (MTS, Eden Prairie, MN). Two-way analysis of variance and post hoc t tests were used to determine any statistically significant differences between groups.In single-leg stance there were significant differences in coronal plane rotation, shear, and axial translation across the subtrochanteric fracture site between the different nail types and the different fracture patterns (p < 0.001). In double-leg stance there were significant differences in coronal plane rotation and femoral head vertical motion between the different nail types and the different fracture patterns (p < 0.001), and there were significant differences in shear and axial translation between the different fracture patterns (p < 0.001) but not the different nail types (p > 0.05).For simple, well-reduced fractures the choice of implant is not critical. As fracture severity increased (comminution, gap, and combined neck fracture), the choice of implant, particularly with reference to proximal nail dimensions and implant materials, was a significant factor in reducing fracture site motion. Therefore, our laboratory data suggest that when subtrochanteric fractures are unstable (e.g., comminution, segmental bone loss) and early weight bearing is desirable, the choice of implant is critical and should be restricted to implants that allow minimal fracture site motion (Long Gamma and Russell-Taylor).",0

Although many marine habitats appear to fit these criteria, confirmed examples of dispersal polymorphism among marine invertebrates are exceedingly rare. Competent larvae of the gregarious tubeworm, Hydroides dianthus, settle specifically in response to living conspecific worms, but a small proportion of each spawn settle nonspecifically on uninhabited substrata concurrently with their gregarious siblings. Here, using a parental half-sib analysis, we show that the proportion of a spawn settling in response to uninhabited biofilm is highly heritable. When estimated as a continuous trait based on a one-way ANOVA, heritability is estimated to be 0.83 ± 0.31. When founder production was analyzed as a threshold trait, heritability was estimated to be 0.68 ± 0.10 based on the breeding design experiment and 0.65 ± 0.09 based on the artificial selection experiments. Realized heritability based on the selection experiments was considerably lower, however (0.17 per generation and 0.02 cumulative). Artificial selection was ineffectual at sequentially increasing the proportion of founder larvae among inbred family lines, but after three generations of selection, the proportion of larvae settling in response to biofilm was significantly higher among inbred lines than among the field-collected parents. The obligate planktonic larval stage common among so many marine invertebrates is thought to preclude the evolution of dispersal polymorphisms in these animals. Theoretical expectations of variable dispersal may instead be realized through individual behavioral differences resulting in differential transport or settlement preference, but this possibility remains largely unexplored among marine invertebrates.Corresponding Editor: R.

,[Contagiousness of monkey pox for humans: results of an investigation of 2 outbreaks of the infection in Zaire].,"The results of the investigation of two outbreaks of group monkeypox infection among humans (altogether 8 cases) in the zone of Bumba, Equatorial Province, Zaire, are presented. The primary source of infection in both outbreaks was not established, the outbreaks were supposedly caused by sick wild animals. Almost all persons affected by this infection were children aged 7 months to 7 years, never vaccinated against smallpox; the only exception was a 29-year old female patient, formerly vaccinated and revaccinated against smallpox. During one of the outbreaks the laboratory-confirmed transmission of infection from man to man was established in two generations. During the other outbreak there were grounds to suspect the transmission of infection in three generations, though the possibility of contacting infection from animals could not be completely ruled out. The existence of the inapparent form of monkeypox in humans was revealed.",0

FIBGC usually follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Despite the mapping to chromosome 14q of a susceptibility locus for IBGC (IBCG1) in one family, this locus has been excluded in several others, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity in this disorder. The etiology of this disorder thus remains largely unknown. Using a large extended multigenerational Italian family from South Tyrol with 17 affected in a total of 56 members, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in which we were able to exclude linkage to the IBCG1 locus on chromosome 14q and obtain evidence of a novel locus on chromosome 2q37.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-012-0354-2,Patient risk factors for outer membrane permeability and KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolation: results of a double case–control study,"In the 1,200-bed university hospital “Umberto I” in Rome, Italy, we observed a dramatic substitution of a precedingly well-documented Klebsiella pneumoniae clone (ST37) with ertapenem resistance by outer membrane permeability modification (Porin-ER-Kp) with a new K. pneumoniae strain expressing carbapenem resistance due to K. pneumoniae carbapenemase production (KPC-CR-Kp). A case–case–control study was carried out to evaluate risk factors for Porin-ER-Kp and KPC-CR-Kp isolation. All patients with hospital-acquired K. pneumoniae isolation between July 2008 and June 2011 were included. Two case groups including patients harbouring KPC-CR-Kp and Porin-ER-Kp were analysed, with a third control group from whom carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CS-Kp) were isolated. Forty-four KPC-CR-Kp cases, 39 Porin-ER-Kp cases and 60 CS-Kp controls were analysed. During the 3-year study, a specific Porin-ER-Kp endemic clone (ST37) was substituted by a new KPC-CR-Kp clone (ST512). Breakthrough bacteraemias occurred in 21 out of 26 KPC-CR-Kp group bloodstream infections (BSIs); nine of these developed during carbapenem therapy and seven with colistin and/or tigecycline therapy. In 13 Porin-ER-Kp BSIs, breakthrough bacteraemias developed in eight patients and four during carbapenem therapy. In the multivariable analysis, KPC-CR-Kp isolates were associated with carbapenems [odds ratio (OR) 7.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.70–35.2; p < 0.01) and endoscopy (OR 6.71; 95 % CI 1.25–36.0; p < 0.03). Porin-ER-Kp independent risk factors included second-generation cephalosporins (OR 25.7; 95 % CI 3.20–206.8; p < 0.01), carbapenems (OR 19.1; 95 % CI 4.34–83.9; p < 0.001), acute renal failure (OR 7.17; 95 % CI 1.33–38.6; p < 0.03), endoscopy (OR 6.12; 95 % CI 1.46–25.6; p < 0.02) and third-generation cephalosporins (OR 5.3; 95 % CI 1.34–20.9; p < 0.02). Porin-ER-Kp strains needed major antimicrobial pressure compared to KPC-CR-Kp to express resistance. KPC-CR-Kp substituted Porin-ER-Kp strains, causing more infections. KPC-CR-Kp breakthrough bacteraemia occurred even under therapy with tigecycline or colistin, underlining that an antibiotic stewardship programme is needed urgently.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfl196,Perspectives: The Possible Influence of Assisted Reproductive Technologies on Transgenerational Reproductive Effects of Environmental Endocrine Disruptors,"Demasculinization by environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is observed in many animal species but less evident in humans. Rodent studies with gestational exposure to either the fungicide vinclozolin or the insecticide methoxychlor demonstrate impaired male fertility with abnormal DNA methylation patterns in spermatozoa. Once established, these epigenetic changes may be permanent and thus paternally passed to subsequent generations. Conclusive evidence of a similar phenomenon in humans has not been established, but several observations bring up the possibility. Some, but not all, studies show an increase in male genital abnormalities after prenatal EDC exposure. Other studies demonstrate sperm abnormalities in males with EDC contact, although it is unclear as to whether this is due to prenatal or postnatal exposure. Although not examined in males with EDC exposure, one study shows gamete DNA methylation abnormalities in males with severe oligospermia. A subsequent study failed to corroborate these findings. The use of assisted reproductive techniques including intracytoplasmic sperm injection has removed natural selection barriers thus enabling reproduction in males that would otherwise be sterile. This review explores the hypothesis that prenatal EDC exposure results in transgenerational male reproductive abnormalities propagated by the use of assisted reproductive technologies.",1

Data for this study were drawn from wave 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Three indicators of IPV were measured and genetic factors accounted for 24% of the variance in hitting one's partner, 54% of the variance in injuring one's partner, and 51% of the variance in forcing sexual activity on one's partner. The shared environment explained none of the variance across all three indicators and the nonshared environment explained the remainder of the variance. These findings point to the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of IPV.",0

Investigating how genetic diversity is patterned among populations that arose following the last Ice Age is a promising method for understanding the potential future effects of climate change. Theoretical and empirical work has suggested that overall genetic diversity can decrease in colonial populations following rapid expansion into postglacial landscapes, with potential negative effects on the ability of populations to adapt to new environmental regimes. The crucial measure of this genetic variation and a population's overall adaptability is the heritable variation in phenotypic traits, as it is this variation that mediates the rate and direction of a population's multigenerational response to selection. Using two large full-sib quantitative genetic studies (N(Manitoba) = 144; N(South Dakota) = 653) and a smaller phenotypic analysis from Kansas (N(Kansas) = 44), we compared mean levels of pigmentation, genetic variation and heritability in three pigmentation traits among populations of the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis, along a north-south gradient, including a postglacial northern population and a putative southern refuge population. Counter to our expectations, we found that genetic variance and heritability for the three pigmentation traits were the same or higher in the postglacial population than in the southern population.",0
,[Sexuality and contraception in adolescence].,Societal attitudes toward sexuality have changed radically in the last few decades. Professional demands on parents increasing material independence of youth and the excess of external stimuli coupled with the average age of 1st menstruation among girls in Europe and the United States being between 12.4 and 13.6 years have led to the start of sexual relations at younger and younger ages. Compared to the rapid physical development which is indicated by the age of puberty continually decreasing psychological development is retarded. Adolescent pregnancies however are acknowledged to be relatively free of significant somatic complications; on the other hand they adversely affect psychological maturation of adolescents. The necessity of sex education at present is realized; its effectiveness however is doubtful. Knowledge of contraception and its proper application seem not to be enough to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Frequently it is the psychological makeup of the individual which leads to unwanted pregnancy. Therefore contraceptive measures should be recommended for adolescents which are safe in practice do not adversely affect fertility and have few side effects. Conventional methods such as the rhythm method spermicides and barrier methods (diaphragm and condom) should be avoided due to their complexity and high failure rates. IUDs should not be used due to the danger of pelvic inflammatory disease and risk of later sterility. Currently the preferred method is a low dose ovulation inhibitor containing a third generation progestogen.,0
https://doi.org/10.2165/00063030-200014010-00003,Platelet-Activating Factor Antagonists,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid-derived mediator of inflammation that is considered to have a potential role in the pathogenesis of asthma. PAF is produced by many cells associated with asthmatic inflammation and has the ability to evoke some of the clinical hallmarks of asthma, such as bronchoconstriction, mucus production and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). In addition, PAF has profound chemoattractant properties for eosinophils and neutrophils and it promotes an increase in microvascular permeability and oedema formation within the airways. Nevertheless, the definitive role of PAF in asthma remains elusive. PAF is formed as a result of the action of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase on membrane phospholipids and it is degraded by a PAF-specific acetylhydrolase. The biological effects of PAF are mediated by the activation of specific receptors expressed on effector cell surfaces, although intracellular signalling and paracrine actions have been described. In addition, at least part of the pulmonary effects of PAF could be related to the secondary release of leukotrienes. In the clinical setting, different ways of modifying the activity of PAF have been explored, in particular the inhibitory actions of PAF receptor antagonists. Both natural and synthetic PAF receptor antagonists have shown conflicting results. Although second generation PAF antagonists (apafant, UK-74505, SR-27417A) appear to have a good protective effect against the systemic and pulmonary actions of inhaled PAF, the protective effects of these compounds on allergen-induced responses and AHR are more modest. In the treatment of asthma, PAF receptor antagonists have failed to produce a significant impact in either acute asthma attacks or the maintenance therapy of chronic forms. Other pharmacological interventions of proven efficacy in asthma, such as salbutamol or 5-lipoxygenase antagonists, have shown some anti-PAF effects. Whether the overall negative results with PAF receptor antagonists indicate that extracellular PAF is not a relevant mediator of airway inflammation or that the compounds explored are not capable of blocking the paracrine actions of PAF remains speculative. A PAF synthase inhibitor could be valuable in the elucidation of the role of PAF and it might be a promising and useful complementary therapeutic tool in the future. blReferences",0

We imaged the brains of 131 individuals, ages 6 to 54 years, who were biological descendants (children or grandchildren) of individuals identified as having either moderate to severe, recurrent, and functionally debilitating depression or as having no lifetime history of depression. We compared cortical thickness across high- and low-risk groups, detecting large expanses of cortical thinning across the lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere in persons at high risk. Thinning correlated with measures of current symptom severity, inattention, and visual memory for social and emotional stimuli. Mediator analyses indicated that cortical thickness mediated the associations of familial risk with inattention, visual memory, and clinical symptoms. These findings suggest that cortical thinning in the right hemisphere produces disturbances in arousal, attention, and memory for social stimuli, which in turn may increase the risk of developing depressive illness.",1
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0605225103,Evolving resistance to obesity in an insect,"Failure to adapt to a changing nutritional environment comes at a cost, as evidenced by the modern human obesity crisis. Consumption of energy-rich diets can lead to obesity and is associated with deleterious consequences not only in humans but also in many other animals, including insects. The question thus arises whether animals restricted over multiple generations to high-energy diets can evolve mechanisms to limit the deposition of adverse levels of body fat. We show that Plutella xylostella caterpillars reared for multiple generations on carbohydrate-rich foods (either a chemically defined artificial diet or a high-starch Arabidopsis mutant) progressively developed the ability to eat excess carbohydrate without laying it down as fat, providing strong evidence that excess fat storage has a fitness cost. In contrast, caterpillars reared in carbohydrate-scarce environments (a chemically defined artificial diet or a low-starch Arabidopsis mutant) had a greater propensity to store ingested carbohydrate as fat. Additionally, insects reared on the low-starch Arabidopsis mutant evolved a preference for laying their eggs on this plant, whereas those selected on the high-starch Arabidopsis mutant showed no preference. Our results provide an experimental example of metabolic adaptation in the face of changes in the nutritional environment and suggest that changes in plant macronutrient profiles may promote host-associated population divergence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9343(87)90798-4,Conversion from low-dose insulin therapy to glipizide in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"This study examines the effect of glipizide therapy in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) previously treated with a low-dose insulin regimen. To determine the comparative safety and efficacy of these two treatment regimens, 135 patients with NIDDM who received low-dose insulin (40 units per day or less) were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter trial. After a four-week period of continued insulin therapy, therapy was converted to the second-generation oral sulfonylurea, glipizide. This report includes efficacy data on 79 patients with NIDDM who completed an eight- to 10-week course of glipizide therapy. A majority of these patients were obese (more than 120 percent of ideal body weight), with a mean age of 61.4 years, and a mean duration of diabetes of 10.0 years. Conversion from low-dose insulin resulted in no deterioration in overall glycemic control as reflected by an unchanged glycosylated hemoglobin at 16 weeks. Seventy patients (89 percent) attained fair glucose control and continued an additional 12 weeks of glipizide maintenance therapy. Subgroup analysis by fasting plasma glucose criteria demonstrated that 44 percent of these patients had statistically significant improvements in glucose control with glipizide as compared with insulin therapy. As this study showed, many patients with NIDDM currently receiving treatment with low-dose insulin can have maintained and some even improved glucose and lipid parameters when therapy is converted to glipizide. The rate of hypoglycemic adverse reactions corrected for duration of treatment in all 135 patients was 0.32 event per patient-month of therapy with insulin as compared with 0.12 event per patient-month of therapy with glipizide. When issues of efficacy, safety, and convenience are considered, it might be more appropriate to administer an oral sulfonylurea to patients with NIDDM rather than proceeding to therapy with insulin.",0

This is largely due to the increased awareness of the contribution of indirect and delayed effects, such as genomic instability, to cellular outcomes after low-dose exposures. It is also due to the availability of tools such as the microbeam and advanced cell culture systems and to the ability to study end points such as gene or protein expression at low doses which were previously difficult to study. This review looks at the history of bystander effects in the earlier literature, in which the clastogenic effect of plasma from irradiated patients was well known. The effect was known to persist for several years and to cause transgenerational effects, making it similar to what we now call genomic instability. The review then examines the current data and controversies which are now beginning to resolve the questions concerning the mechanisms underlying the induction and transmission of both bystander effects and genomic instability. Finally, the possible impact of data concerning radiation-induced bystander effects on radiotherapy and radiation protection is discussed.",1

The objectives of the present experiment were: (1) to determine the sensitivity of the male germ-cell stages to the induction of translocations by the compound, and (2) to characterize translocation configurations in F 1 and F 2 males, in order to obtain information about the pattern of chromosome breakage induced and its transmission to subsequent generations. Of 508 F 1 males studied, 39 were partially sterile and 9 were fully sterile. The group of males conceived 8–21 days after treatment contained by far the highest proportion of partially sterile animals (30%). It was also the only group in which totally sterile animals (11%) were found. Of 25 semisterile males from this group, 24 gave evidence of translocations when spermatocytes were scored at diakinesis. The translocation frequencies in F 1 derived from treated spermatozoa and spermatocytes were 14 and 1%, respectively. No translocations were detected cytologically 6 semisterile males derived from treated spermatogonial stages. These results indicate that spermatid stages are especially sensitive to the mutagenic action of cyclophosphamide. In 21 of the 31 semisterile translocation males (68%), the majority of the spermatocytes contained 18 bivalents plus a ring-of-four configuration, indicating that both breakpoints were relatively centrally located; and in several of these males, the frequency of cells with rings was close to 100%. In another 9 F 1 males (29%) the predominant multivalent configuration was a chain-of-four, indicating one of the breakpoints to be relatively more terminally located; and in one male (3%), the majority of cells had two unequal bivalents, indicating both breakpoints to be fairly close to the ends of the chromosomes involved. Determination of centromere positions by the use of C-banding showed that chain-of-four configurations in any one male were predominantly of a given type. Associations of more than one translocation were observed in 11 of 31 translocation males, but in a very low frequency (about 1% of the spermatocytes). The results indicate that cyclophosphamide induces a relatively random pattern of chromosome break location. In this respect this mutagen more closely resembles X-rays than it does certain chemicals for which there isf evidence that breakpoint position is frequently subterminal. Our data indicate that the pattern of configurations observed in F 1 was in general transmitted to F 2 .",1

An ongoing collaboration between Umeå University, Sweden and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Childhood, Bristol University, UK has documented transgenerational correlations between food supply during the early life of the paternal grandparents and the grandchild's longevity, including associations with cardiovascular and diabetic deaths, and correlations between the onset of paternal smoking in mid-childhood and the body mass index of future sons.

We have used molecular marker-assisted selection in a backcross breeding program to introgress three genes (Xa21, xa13, and xa5) for BB resistance into Triguna, a mid-early duration, high yielding rice variety that is susceptible to BB. At each generation in the backcross program, molecular markers were used to select plants possessing these resistance genes and to select plants that have maximum contribution from the Triguna genome. A selected BC3F1 plant was selfed to generate homozygous BC3F2 plants with different combinations of BB resistance genes. Plants containing the two-gene combination, Xa21 and xa13, were found to exhibit excellent resistance against BB. Single plant selections for superior agronomic characteristics were performed on the progeny of these plants, from BC3F3 generation onwards. The selected plants were subjected to yield trials at the BC3F8 generation and were found to have a significant yield advantage over Triguna. The newly developed lines are being entered into national multi-location field trials. This work represents a successful example of the application of molecular marker-assisted selection for BB resistance breeding in rice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0029-7844(97)00132-4,Third-generation oral contraceptives and thromboembolism risk,"Recently, observational studies have suggested an increased risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolic complications in women using oral contraceptives (OCs) containing the third-generation progestins, gestodene and desogestrel. Because of the observational, rather than randomized, nature of these trials, the clinical relevance of these findings is difficult to interpret. Each study included one or more potential sources of bias. In particular, cases came almost exclusively from hospitalized patients with nonfatal venous thromboembolism, which represents only a minority of patients diagnosed with this condition according to current clinical practice. In the absence of a sound biologic rationale to explain the increased risk with third-generation OCs, and considering the potential sources of bias within the current studies, an alternative view argues against causality. Oral contraceptives remain safe and effective. Clearly, additional research is needed to determine the relationship between thromboembolic disease and the use of third-generation OCs. In the interim, women should be informed thoroughly with objective data on all risks associated with the use of OCs.",0

A survey of eucalyptus trees planted in parks and other public areas showed a significant spatial correlation between trap catch and breeding populations, validating the trap survey results. Traps in trees showing damage had four-fold higher catches than traps placed in undamaged or nonhost trees, and < 1% of damaged trees with traps failed to catch adult moths. Damage by larval feeding was correlated with male trap catch in the previous generation, offering good prospects for a pest management decision support system, provided that an economic threshold is developed. Catches increased by 3.4-fold in the same georeferenced trapping grid between November and December 2003 and between March and April 2004 across two generations, over the summer. A vertical transect showed that catches increased with height up to the top trap at 13 m (60% of mean tree height). Options for managing the insect will need to overcome the high rate of increase, the rate of spread, and the vertical distribution of the insect on tall eucalyptus trees.",0
https://doi.org/10.2106/00004623-199906000-00009,Analysis of Temporal Wear Patterns of Porous-Coated Acetabular Components,"Standard radiographic assessment of penetration by the femoral head into a polyethylene liner does not enable clinicians to distinguish between the two processes that cause movement of the head: true wear (the removal of polyethylene particles) and so-called bedding-in (other factors, such as creep and settling-in of the liner). By analyzing radiographs made over time, researchers can distinguish true wear from the bedding-in process. The purpose of the current study was to compare the wear performance of the initial modular acetabular cup design (so-called first-generation components) of three different manufacturers with that of a so-called second-generation component made by one of the manufacturers.A two-dimensional computerized radiographic method was used to analyze 1300 radiographs of 315 hips that were followed for 3.0 to 10.5 years. Temporal penetration by the head in the three groups of first-generation cups was compared with penetration in the group of second-generation cups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to model penetration-versus-time data as a line for each group. The slope of each regression line indicated the true rate of wear, and the intercept of the regression line indicated the amount of bedding-in.Modifications in the design of the second-generation components, including thicker polyethylene and an improved locking mechanism, led to a decrease in the mean penetration by the head; however, the second-generation component did not have a lower true rate of wear than two of the first-generation components. Rather, the decreased penetration by the head into the second-generation component resulted from decreased bedding-in of the liner.These findings and this technique of analysis are clinically relevant to surgeons who evaluate polyethylene wear radiographically. First, penetration by the head in the early postoperative years might not be due entirely to abrasive wear of the polyethylene liner but, rather, to a change in the position of the head resulting from the bedding-in process. The inclusion of bedding-in in calculations of wear artificially inflates the rate of wear and may result in a misrepresentation of the potential risk of wear-related complications. This is especially true with regard to comparisons of different designs of modular cups, in which conformity and tolerances between the polyethylene liner and the metal shell can vary greatly. Second, analysis of penetration by the head at multiple time-intervals can be used to distinguish true polyethylene wear from the bedding-in process. Such an analysis allows more accurate determination of the true rates of wear of different designs of modular cups and, therefore, of potential wear-related complications.",0

The aims of this study were to review the pathogens associated with nosocomial infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Turkey and to summarize rates of antimicrobial resistance in the most common pathogens. The survey was conducted over a period of twelve months in a tertiary-care teaching hospital located in the south-eastern part of Turkey, Gaziantep. A total of 871 clinical specimens from 615 adult patients were collected. From 871 clinical specimens 771 bacterial and fungal isolates were identified.Most commonly isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), Candida species (15%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.9%). Among the Gram-negative microorganisms P. aeruginosa were mostly resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (71.3-98.1%), while Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant in all cases to piperacillin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Isolates of S. aureus were mostly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and methicillin (82-95%), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were 98.6% resistant to methicillin and in all cases resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline.In order to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in ICUs, monitoring and optimization of antimicrobial use in hospitals are strictly recommended. Therefore local resistance surveillance programs are of most value in developing appropriate therapeutic guidelines for specific infections and patient types.",0

Fifty Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision –(DSM-IV-TR)–diagnosed schizophrenic outpatients were evaluated through a psychiatric assessment. Drug attitudes were measured using the Drug Attitude Inventory and insight using the Scale for the Assessment of Unawareness of Mental Disorder. Differences between patients taking first- or second-generation antipsychotics were investigated. Lack of insight, more severe scores on the positive and general psychopathology subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and later age at onset of schizophrenia correlated with worse global medication attitude. The multiple regression analysis revealed that unawareness of the need of treatment predicted poorer drug global attitude ( R 2 = 0.312). Patients taking second-generation antipsychotics showed lower negative attitudes and better global drug attitudes than patients treated with neuroleptics. The impact of the awareness of the need for treatment on global medication attitude needs to be a main focus of interventions targeting compliance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.9.9.868,CAP3: A DNA Sequence Assembly Program,"We describe the third generation of the CAP sequence assembly program. The CAP3 program includes a number of improvements and new features. The program has a capability to clip 5′ and 3′ low-quality regions of reads. It uses base quality values in computation of overlaps between reads, construction of multiple sequence alignments of reads, and generation of consensus sequences. The program also uses forward–reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link contigs. Results of CAP3 on four BAC data sets are presented. The performance of CAP3 was compared with that of PHRAP on a number of BAC data sets. PHRAP often produces longer contigs than CAP3 whereas CAP3 often produces fewer errors in consensus sequences than PHRAP. It is easier to construct scaffolds with CAP3 than with PHRAP on low-pass data with forward–reverse constraints.",0

However, anthropologists question the cross-cultural equivalence of depression, particularly at a life stage so influenced by cultural factors.To develop a qualitative method to explore whether postnatal depression is universally recognised, attributed and described and to enquire into people's perceptions of remedies and services for morbid states of unhappiness within the context of local services.The study took place in 15 centres in 11 countries and drew on three groups of informants: focus groups with new mothers, interviews with fathers and grandmothers, and interviews with health professionals. Textual analysis of these three groups was conducted separately in each centre and emergent themes compared across centres.All centres described morbid unhappiness after childbirth comparable to postnatal depression but not all saw this as an illness remediable by health interventions.Although the findings of this study support the universality of a morbid state of unhappiness following childbirth, they also support concerns about the cross-cultural equivalence of postnatal depression as an illness requiring the intervention of health professionals; this has implications for future research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.010782,Delayed Abscission and Shorter Internodes Correlate with a Reduction in the Ethylene Receptor <i>LeETR1</i> Transcript in Transgenic Tomato,"Stable transformation of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv Ailsa Craig) plants with a construct containing the antisense sequence for the receiver domain and 3'-untranslated portion of the tomato ethylene receptor (LeETR1) under the control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter resulted in some expected and unexpected phenotypes. In addition to reduced LeETR1 transcript levels, the two most consistently observed phenotypes in the transgenic lines were delayed abscission and reduced plant size. Fruit coloration and softening were essentially unaffected, and all the seedlings from first generation seed displayed a normal triple response to ethylene. Two independent lines with a single copy of the transgene and reduced LeETR1 transcript accumulation were selected for detailed phenotypic analysis of second generation (R1) plants. Delayed abscission, shorter internode length, and reduced auxin movement all correlated with the presence of the transgene and the degree of reduced LeETR1 transcript accumulation. No significant differences were noted for fruit coloration or fruit softening on R1 plants and all seedlings from R1 and R2 seed displayed a normal triple response. LeETR2 transcript accumulation was only slightly reduced in the R1 plants compared with azygous plants, and LeETR3 (NR) transcript levels appeared to be unaffected by the transgene. We propose that ethylene signal transduction occurs through parallel paths that partially intersect to regulate shared ethylene responses.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/icl.0b013e318275e284,Microbial Adhesion to Silicone Hydrogel Lenses,"Microbial adhesion to contact lenses is believed to be one of the initiating events in the formation of many corneal infiltrative events, including microbial keratitis, that occur during contact lens wear. The advent of silicone hydrogel lenses has not reduced the incidence of these events. This may partly be related to the ability of microbes to adhere to these lenses. The aim of this study was to review the published literature on microbial adhesion to contact lenses, focusing on adhesion to silicone hydrogel lenses.The literature on microbial adhesion to contact lenses was searched, along with associated literature on adverse events that occur during contact lens wear. Particular reference was paid to the years 1995 through 2012 because this encompasses the time when the first clinical trials of silicone hydrogel lenses were reported, and their commercial availability and the publication of epidemiology studies on adverse events were studied.In vitro studies of bacterial adhesion to unworn silicone hydrogel lens have shown that generally, bacteria adhere to these lenses in greater numbers than to the hydroxyethyl methacrylate-based soft lenses. Lens wear has different effects on microbial adhesion, and this is dependent on the type of lens and microbial species/genera that is studied. Biofilms that can be formed on any lens type tend to protect the bacteria and fungi from the effects on disinfectants. Fungal hyphae can penetrate the surface of most types of lenses. Acanthamoeba adhere in greater numbers to first-generation silicone hydrogel lenses compared with the second-generation or hydroxyethyl methacrylate-based soft lenses.Microbial adhesion to silicone hydrogel lenses occurs and is associated with the production of corneal infiltrative events during lens wear.",0
,Accuracy of the Raypex-4 and Propex apex locators in detecting horizontal and vertical root fractures: an in vitro study.,"Unforeseen root fractures during endodontic therapy are often difficult to diagnose and treat. Apex locators have been shown to be accurate in measuring the working lengths of root canals, and it was postulated whether they could also be used to determine the position of root fractures. This study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of two different apex locators in determining the position of fractures. One hundred single rooted teeth were randomly divided into two groups. One group had simulated horizontal fractures cut into them and the other group had vertical fractures. All fractures were detected in both groups using both a Propex (third generation) and a Raypex-4 (fourth generation) apex locator. The actual lengths of the fractures were then measured under 2.5 times magnification, and the results subjected to statistical analysis. Both locators produced similar results and were found to be very accurate, with measurements that correlated closely to the actual lengths. Clinically, treatment options for root fractures vary depending on their location. Thus apex locators may be a valuable aid in not only determining the presence of a root fracture, but also its exact location, which will help the clinician decide on the most appropriate management.",0

A case report and a review of the literature,"Although scattered case reports of familial clustering of pancreatic cancer have appeared in the literature, hereditary factors have not been clearly associated with increased risk for this malignancy. The current report documents the familial occurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in three women of consecutive generations who died of their disease at progressively younger ages. The diagnoses are histologically confirmed in all three cases. Although two of the women carried a single known risk factor for pancreatic carcinoma (cigarette smoking), a familial predisposition to this disease is strongly implicated. The case suggests that the role of inheritance in pancreatic carcinoma may merit further exploration.",0

In the youngest generation, two members had so severe choreic hyperkinesis that gait was impaired in one of them and totally impeded in the other; they also had associated mental retardation, which was not present in other members with variable degrees of hyperkinesis. There was no therapeutic response to several drugs. The literature regarding genetical, clinical and therapeutic aspects of this condition is reviewed, and it is concluded that the most adequate denomination for the disease is familial nonprogressive chorea rather that the accepted one of benign familiar chorea.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00332775,Mutations of the Adh1 gene in maize following infection with barley stripe mosaic virus,"Mutations at the Adh1 locus in maize were selected from plants infected with barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV). Pollen from the infected inbred line 1s2p, which is homozygous for Adh1-S (abbreviated S), Adh2-P, c and r was treated with allyl alcohol and applied to silks of a tester stock homozygous for Adh1-F, Adh2-N, C and R. From these pollinations 356 kernels arose on the F1 ears. Of these eight showed no activity of the S allele in scutellar samples while two exhibited low levels. Five of the putative mutant kernels germinated and two of these contained the contamination markers Adh2-P, c and r. The newly arisen mutations were designated S5446 and S5453. S5453 exhibited an abnormally low level of ADH activity in the F1 scutellum. In the F2 generation the mutant reverted at a high frequency with only about 5% of the S5453 alleles expressing low levels. DNA blotting and hybridization analyses showed no alterations in the restriction patterns of S5453 when compared to the progenitor S allele. S5446 which exhibited no ADH activity in the F1 scutellum is unstable in the pollen; reversion frequencies approaching 10(-2) were observed in samples from some plants. Restriction digestion patterns of DNA from this mutant revealed the presence of a 3.3 kb insertion at Adh. The insert does not appear to contain sequences homologous to the BSMV genome but rigorous analyses remain to be carried out. It is hypothesized that BSMV infection may mobilize endogenous but dormant transposable elements in maize.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0003-3472(66)80052-0,The effect on growth and behaviour of rehabilitating first and second generation low protein rats,"Summary o 1. Two experiments are described in which rats fed on a low protein diet were rehabilitated on a laboratory diet containing a higher percentage of protein. In one experiment first generation low protein rats were rehabilitated at weaning and tested on the Hebb-Williams test of animal intelligence and Hall's open field test of emotionality. In the second experiment a second generation of low protein rats were fed the rehabilitation diet from weaning, and their offspring tested by means of a number of developmental tests and the Hebb-Williams test of intelligence. 2. The retardation in the growth and development became more marked as successive generations of rats were reared on the low protein diet. 3. Feeding first generation low protein rats the rehabilitation diet from weaning facilitated their growth, but when mature their problem solving ability remained below that of normal rats. 4. Feeding the second generation low protein rats the rehabilitation diet from weaning and retaining both them and their offspring on the rehabilitation diet did not their offspring on the effects of the low protein diet. The offspring were retarded in growth, development and intelligence. 5. It is concluded that a low protein diet fed to one generation of rats affects the growth and development of the next generation; this seems to be due, at least in part, to a deficiency in the nutrients received from the mother during the foetal period. In rehabilitating low protein rats, more than one generation may have to be fed on a high plane of nutrition before all the effects of the low protein diet are overcome.",1

The results for males were consistent with genetically influenced peer selection mechanisms as mediators of parent alcoholism effects. Male children of alcoholics were less likely to be carriers of the G allele in single nucleotide polymorphism A118G ( rs1799971 ), and those who were homozygous for the A allele were more likely to affiliate with alcohol use promoting peers who increased the risk for AUD symptoms at all ages. There was evidence for women of an interaction between OPRM1 variation and peer affiliations but only at the earliest age band. Peer influences had stronger effects among women who were G-carriers. These results illustrate the complex ways in which the interplay between influences at multiple levels of analysis can underlie the intergenerational transmission of alcohol disorders as well as the importance of considering age and gender differences in these pathways.",0

Thickness of RNFL along a 3.4-mm-diameter circle centered on the optic nerve head was evaluated using third-generation optical coherence tomography. Patients in group A (39 eyes of 22 patients) were human immunodeficiency virus-negative control subjects. Group B (36 eyes of 18 patients) was composed of HIV patients with no history of CMV retinitis and CD4 counts consistently above 100. Group C (38 eyes of 25 patients) comprised HIV patients with no history of CMV retinitis but a history of CD4 count less than 100 at some point lasting for at least 6 months.The average RNFL thicknesses in groups A, B, and C were 103.33 +/- 8.50 microm, 103.30 +/- 9.28 microm, and 90.10 +/- 12.50 microm, respectively. Group C had significantly thinner overall RNFL than either of the groups A and B (Tukey-Kramer). This difference was most prominent in temporal, superior, and inferior retinal areas. No difference was in nasal retinal area, nor between groups A and B in any of the areas.Significant RNFL thinning occurs in HIV patients without CMV retinitis and with low CD4 counts compared with the same subgroup of patients with CD4 count increased to above 100 and HIV-negative control subjects. Third-generation OCT may be useful in diagnosis of early subclinical HIV-associated visual functional loss.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2009-0982,Vinclozolin Exposure in Utero Induces Postpubertal Prostatitis and Reduces Sperm Production via a Reversible Hormone-Regulated Mechanism,"Vinclozolin is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that binds with high affinity to the androgen receptor (AR) and blocks the action of gonadal hormones on male reproductive organs. An alternative mechanism of action of Vinclozolin involves transgenerational effects on the male reproductive tract. We previously reported in utero Vinclozolin exposure-induced prostatitis (prostate inflammation) in postpubertal rats concurrent with down-regulation of AR and increased nuclear factor-κB activation. We postulated the male reproductive abnormalities induced by in utero Vinclozolin exposure could be reversed by testosterone supplementation, in contrast to the permanent modifications involving DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) described by others. To test this hypothesis, we administered high-dose testosterone at puberty to Vinclozolin-treated rats and determined the effect on anogenital distance (AGD); testicular germ cell apoptosis, concentration of elongated spermatids, and the onset of prostatitis. Concurrently we examined Dnmt1, −3A, −3B, and −3L mRNA expression. Consistent with previous reports, in utero exposure to Vinclozolin significantly reduced AGD, increased testicular germ cell apoptosis 3-fold, reduced elongated spermatid number by 40%, and induced postpubertal prostatitis in 100% of exposed males. Administration of high-dose testosterone (25 mg/kg) at puberty normalized AGD, reduced germ cell apoptosis, and restored elongated spermatid number. Testosterone restored AR and nuclear factor-κB expression in the prostate and abolished Vinclozolin-induced prostatitis. Altered Dnmt expression was evident with in utero Vinclozolin exposure and was not normalized after testosterone treatment. These data demonstrate in utero Vinclozolin-induced male reproductive tract abnormalities are AR mediated and reversible and involve a mechanism independent of Dnmt expression.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-124-4-1689,Generation of Osteoclastic Function in Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures: Multinuclearity and Tartrate- Resistant Acid Phosphatase Are Unreliable Markers for Osteoclastic Differentiation*,"The osteoclast is the cell that resorbs bone. It is known to derive from hemopoietic precursors, and a series of recent experiments has used enumeration of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleate cells that develop in cultures of hemopoietic tissue as a means to analyze the regulation of osteoclast generation. These multinucleate cells have never been definitively characterized as osteoclasts, however, and we elected to assess the relationship among bone resorption (the primary function of the osteoclast), TRAP, and multinuclearity in mouse bone marrow cultures. Mouse bone marrow cells and peritoneal macrophages were incubated on plastic coverslips or bone slices for up to 14 days in the presence or absence of 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3]. Osteoclast generation, as judged by bone resorption, occurred in marrow cell cultures only in the presence of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. However, TRAP-positive multinuclear cells developed both with and without the hormone. The multinuclear cells bound F4/80, a marker for macrophages that does not bind to osteoclasts. Peritoneal macrophages became multinucleate and developed TRAP positivity in culture to levels similar to those in freshly isolated osteoclasts, especially with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3, but remained nonresorptive. In cultures of marrow cells incubated with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 bone resorption was more extensive than could readily be accounted for by the number of multinucleate cells present, and the size of excavations and extent of resorption suggested a major contribution by mononuclear cells with osteoclastic function. Thus, while TRAP and multinuclearity are reliable markers for osteoclastic phenotype in bone, they are unreliable markers in culture. Experiments designed to evaluate the regulation of osteoclast generation through enumeration of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells formed in bone marrow cultures will not only overstate, to an unknown and probably variable degree, the number of multinucleate osteoclasts that develop, but will also fail to even identify what may be a considerable and more substantial population of mononuclear cells that possess osteoclastic characteristics.",0

The approval in 1996 of the first of the second generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, donepexil (Aricept, Eisai/Pfizer), has offered new hope, albeit palliative, to AD sufferers and care givers. Research has continued on the genetics of AD with the identification of the autosomal dominant inheritance of genetic defects in one of three distinct genes coding for the presensilins 1 and 2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP). While driving an ever increasing research effort related to the production, deposition and clearance of Abeta peptides, these mutations account for less than 10% of the AD cases reported, indicating that other causative factors, both genetic and environmental, may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD unrelated to familial cohorts. A newly developed transgenic mouse model and a broader appreciation of the multifactorial nature of this complex, chronic disease state may help provide a more objective approach to understanding the disease per se as opposed to amyloid neurotoxicity specifically which may or may not be causative.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00709-004-0063-5,Deterministic cellular descendance and its relationship to the branching of plant organ axes,"A double-wall map L-system, designated as S5-5, was developed to simulate the cellular pattern found at the summit of shoot apices of Psilotum nudum. Commencing from a 3-sided autoreproductive founder cell, fives steps of simulation established a basic set of ten different cell types. Continuing the simulation beyond the fifth step revealed that, in addition to the regular production of new 3-sided cells, a group of autoreproductive 5-sided cells came into being. A close correspondence exists between the cells of the two-dimensional simulation and the two-dimensional cellular patterns found on the epidermis of the apices of Psilotum species. The 3-sided cells produced during the simulation correspond to the potentially organogenetic 3-sided cells that can be seen upon the apical surfaces. Successive generations of these 3-sided apical cells (which are actually 4-sided tetrahedral cells when viewed in three dimensions) and their immediate descendants are thought to be selected to organise the successive pairs of apices that bring about the repeated bifurcation of the Psilotum shoots. The 5-sided cells contribute to the cellular “pavements” which separate these pairs of organogenetic centres, each with their 3-sided apical cells. The cellular patterns simulated by the S5-5 system may also correspond to the cellular patterns found on the surfaces of some other pteridophyte apices, including that of the rhizophores of Selaginella species. Tritiated-thymidine labelling of rhizophore apices revealed a group of nonproliferating cells that was associated with rhizophore bifurcation and which may correspond to a group of pavement cells. Nonproliferating cells, by regulating the siting of new organogenetic centres, may have evolved as an accompaniment to branching events such as the bifurcation of root and organ axes.",0
,[Prevention of cheilognathopalatoschisis. Clinical Experience (author's transl)].,"Symptomatic prophylaxis for pregnant women in whose relatives facial clefts have appeared has been carried out since 1958. This report of over 20 years' experience shows the difference between data from clinical histories which give a heredity ratio of about 17% and the careful family investigation in families with cheilognathopalatoschisis. These family investigations show (and this is understandable) a considerably higher heredity ratio, because in certain respects they represent a negative selection. Thus we find in the F1-F4 generation of families subject to clefts, values of about 40 to 50%. In contrast there is a treatment group which has undergone symptomatic prophylaxis by administration of vitamins and an oxygen-activating medicament in which a significant lowering of the deformity rate is shown in ""cleft-positive"" mothers treated in early pregnancy.",1
,[Glucose abnormalities in a 14-year old patient treated with a second generation antipsychotic].,"The increased risk of diabetes mellitus in adult patients treated with second generation antipsychotics is a topic that has been vigorously debated in recent years. However, a literature search indicates that only very limited information is available about the use and the potential metabolic risks of antipsychotics in children and adolescents. We present and discuss a case study in which severe glucose abnormalities were detected in a 14-year-old, non-psychotic patient who was being treated with risperidone. The glucose abnormalities were found to be reversible when risperidone was discontinued. The case-study highlights the importance of screening for and detection of metabolic abnormalities in children and adolescents who are being treated with second generation antipsychotics. It is particularly important that children with additional risk factors are closely monitored.",0

A three-generation study of isomer β effects on reproductive and developmental parameters in rats,"Propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME) is widely used as a solvent in numerous commercial products. Its chemical synthesis leads to the formation of two isomers: a and b, the latter being usually present in the range of 0.5-1.5%. Isomer α has been shown to be of low toxicity. Isomer β raises concerns as to its reproductive and developmental effects. We evaluated the reproductive and developmental toxicity of two different commercial mixes of PGME (Mix A: 99% isomer α and 0.5% isomer β, Mix B: 98.5% isomer α and 1.5% isomer β) on Sprague-Dawley rats. The use of two mixes allowed us to differentiate between isomer α and isomer β effects. Male and female rats were exposed through drinking water to mixes A or B during a gametogenesis cycle (64 days for males and 15 days for females) to 0, 2, 5, 10 and 15% (v/v) of each mix. These animals (F 0 ) and the three following generations (F 1 , F 2 and F 3 ) were followed. We observed a statistically significant decrease in the number of pups in isomer α-treated animals of generation F 1 and a nondose-related variation of the sex ratio in F 1 and F 2 generations after PGME mix B treatment. The most important effect observed was a decrease in testicular and epididymal sperm counts in relation to PGME isomer β in acute daily exposure, on the first parental generation. The effect evidenced on sex ratio needs further work in order to assay the potential persistent effects of PGME exposure.",1
https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20121023-12,Ceramic-on-ceramic Total Hip Arthroplasty: Incidence and Risk Factors of Bearing Surface–related Noises in 125 Patients,"The ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surface has high wear resistance and good biocompatibility in total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the postoperative noise problem has been an important issue. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of bearing surface-related noises in patients with third-generation ceramic-on-ceramic THAs. One hundred twenty-five patients (143 hips) with ceramic-on-ceramic THAs were included in the study and followed to obtain noise and functional results. Patient factors, including sex, age, height, weight, body mass index, diagnosis, and postoperative range of motion, and surgical factors, including cup inclination, ceramic head size and length, and size of cup related to noises, were recorded. Mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 2-10 years). Mean Harris Hip Score was 94 points (range, 68-100 points) at latest follow-up. One (0.8%) patient had radiological evidence of osteolysis, and 4 (3.2%) patients had hip dislocation. No hip sustained a fracture of the ceramic component. Eight (6.4%) patients developed noise at their hips, including clicking in 4, grinding in 2, and snapping in 2. No patient developed squeaking hips or underwent revision surgery because of noisy hips. Younger patients (P=.01), a diagnosis of osteonecrosis (P=.014), a 28-mm ceramic head (P=.042), and a higher hip range of motion postoperatively (P=.001) were related to noise in ceramic-on-ceramic THAs. The study showed third-generation ceramic-on-ceramic THAs had a low incidence of noise problems. However, long-term follow-up is necessary to determine the clinical relevance.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-012-9550-1,Current Parental Depression and Offspring Perceived Self-Competence: A Quasi-Experimental Examination,"A genetically-informed, quasi-experimental design was used to examine the genetic and environmental processes underlying associations between current parental depressive symptoms and offspring perceived self-competence. Participants, drawn from a population-based Swedish sample, were 852 twin pairs and their male (52 %) and female offspring aged 15.7 ± 2.4 years. Parental depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Offspring perceived self-competence was measured using a modified Harter Perceived Competence Scale. Cousin comparisons and Children of Twins designs suggested that associations between maternal depressive symptoms and offspring perceived self-competence were due to shared genetic/environmental liability. The mechanism responsible for father-offspring associations, however, was independent of genetic factors and of extended family environmental factors, supporting a causal inference. Thus, mothers and fathers may impact offspring perceived self-competence via different mechanisms and unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying the intergenerational transmission of cognitive vulnerabilities for depression.",0
,[Subjective aspects of pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia during implementation of chlorpromazine in Poland--a review].,"Introduction of chlorpromazine was the breakthrough in psychiatric practice. Pharmacotherapy with chlorpromazine started in Polish hospitals in the autumn and winter in 1954 and the first papers covering clinical experiences started to be published in 1955. Some of these papers are very informative about subjective aspects of pharmacotherapy, comparison of older and new method of treatment, changes of psychiatric wards atmosphere. They inform also about some social aspects of introduction of this new drug to the practice. In the example families were involved in gaining the drugs for ill family members and doctors sometimes had to win persons' in charge consent to start treatment. In this papers the hope that patients treated with the new drug are more prone to psychotherapy have been expressed. This kind of hope is now expressed in regard to the second generation of antipsychotics. The paper of a Polish author published 1969 that is the pioneering work in the field of research of subjective aspects of pharmacotherapy is presented. Conclusions and methodology of this study are very similar to the later studies that were published in psychiatric literature at the end of 1970's.",0
https://doi.org/10.1039/c1ob06052j,"Synthesis and oxidation of 2-hydroxynevirapine, a metabolite of the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine","Nevirapine (11-cyclopropyl-5,11-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b:2',3'-e][1,4]diazepin-6-one, NVP) is a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. However, severe hepatotoxicity and serious adverse cutaneous effects have raised concerns about the safety of NVP administration. NVP metabolism yields several phenol-type derivatives conceivably capable of undergoing further metabolic oxidation to electrophilic quinoid species that could react with bionucleophiles. The covalent adducts thus formed might be at the genesis of toxic responses. As an initial step to test this hypothesis, we synthesized the phenolic metabolite, 2-hydroxy-NVP, and investigated its oxidation in vitro. Using potassium nitrosodisulfonate and sodium periodate as model oxidants, we obtained evidence for fast generation of an electrophilic quinone-imine, which readily underwent hydrolytic conversion to fully characterized spiro derivatives, 1'-cyclopropyl-4-methyl-1H,1'H-spiro[pyridine-2,2'-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine]-3,4',6(3'H)-trione in aqueous media and 1'-cyclopropyl-4-methyl-1'H,2H-spiro[pyridine-3,2'-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine]-2,4',6(1H,3'H)-trione in non-aqueous media. The spiro compound generated in aqueous solution underwent subsequent hydrolytic degradation of the NVP ring system, whereas the one formed in non-aqueous media was stable to hydrolysis. The product profile observed with the chemical oxidants in aqueous solution was replicated using lactoperoxidase-mediated oxidation of 2-hydroxy-NVP. These observations suggest that metabolic activation of NVP, via Phase I oxidation to 2-hydroxy-NVP and subsequent generation of a quinone-imine, could occur in vivo and play a role in NVP-induced toxicity.",0

https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2005.067702,Young Adult Caregivers: A First Look at an Unstudied Population,"Objectives. We examined the prevalence, characteristics, and responsibilities of young adults aged 18 to 25 years who are caregivers for ill, elderly, or disabled family members or friends. Methods. We analyzed 2 previously published national studies (from 1998 and 2004) of adult caregivers. Results. Young adult caregivers make up between 12% and 18% of the total number of adult caregivers. Over half are male, and the average age is 21. Most young adults are caring for a female relative, most often a grandmother. Young adult caregivers identified a variety of unmet needs, including obtaining medical help, information, and help making end-of-life decisions. Conclusions. Analysis of these 2 surveys broadens our understanding of the spectrum of family caregivers by focusing on caregivers between the ages of 18 and 25 years. The high proportion of young men raises questions about the appropriateness of current support services, which are typically used by older women. Concerted efforts are essential to ensure that young adults who become caregivers are not deterred from pursuing educational and career goals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.0280s6015.x,Histamine - a major role in allergy?,"Since its discovery in 1911, histamine has been recognized as a major mediator in allergic reactions and diseases, and today antihistamines remain important agents in the treatment of these conditions. In addition to its known effects on glands, vessels and sensory nerves, recent data have provided further evidence of histamine's proinflammatory actions, which appear to be mediated mainly by H1 receptors. Thus, findings indicate that histamine is a crucial mediator in both the early and late-phase reactions of an allergic response, playing important roles in cytokine release and in the adhesion process. Histamine has been shown to increase the adhesion of leucocytes to the endothelium and to stimulate production of IL-6 and IL-8 by endothelial cells. It also increases TNF alpha-induced IL-6 production and expression of adhesion molecules. These effects can be inhibited by H1 receptor antagonists. First-generation antihistamines, though moderately effective, showed poor selectivity and caused sedation, due to their penetration of the blood-brain barrier, and other troublesome side-effects. Second-generation antihistamines such as ebastine have increased potency due to greater selectivity for histamine receptors, and improved tolerability due to lack of penetration of the blood brain barrier. Recent studies have shown ebastine 10 mg daily to be effective, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), with a rapid onset of action, symptom relief comparable to that seen with topical azelastine or oral loratadine 10 mg o.d., cetirizine 10 mg o.d. or terfenadine 60 mg b.i.d., and no significant side-effects. Ebastine therefore offers a new option in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.",0
https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-200565002-00002,Vascular Effects of Calcium Channel Antagonists: New Evidence,"Calcium channel antagonists have a well-established role in the management of cardiovascular diseases. L-type calcium channels in vascular cells are a key therapeutic target in hypertension and are the preferred molecular target of the initial calcium channel antagonists. However, third-generation dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonists, including manidipine, nilvadipine, benidipine and efonidipine, appear to have effects in addition to blockade of the L-type calcium channel. Voltage-gated calcium channels are widely expressed throughout the cardiovascular system. They constitute the main route for calcium entry, essential for the maintenance of contraction. Cardiac and vascular cells predominantly express L-type calcium channels. More recently, T-type channels have been discovered, and there is emerging evidence of their significance in the regulation of arterial resistance. A lack of functional expression of L-type channels in renal efferent arterioles may be consistent with an important role of T-type channels in the regulation of efferent arteriolar tone. Although the exact role of T-type calcium channels in vascular beds remains to be determined, they could be associated with gene-activated cell replication and growth during pathology. The three major classes of calcium channel antagonists are chemically distinct, and exhibit different functional effects depending on their biophysical, conformation-dependent interactions with the L-type calcium channel. The DHPs are more potent vasodilators, and generally have less cardiodepressant activity than representatives of other classes of calcium channel antagonist such as diltiazem (a phenylalkylamine) and verapamil (a benzothiazepine). In contrast to older calcium channel antagonists, the newer DHPs, manidipine, nilvadipine, benidipine and efonidipine, dilate not only afferent but also efferent renal arterioles, a potentially beneficial effect that may improve glomerular hypertension and provide renoprotection. The underlying mechanisms for the heterogenous effects of calcium channel antagonists in the renal microvasculature are unclear. A credible hypothesis suggests a contribution of T-type calcium channels to efferent arteriolar tone, and that manidipine, nilvadipine and efonidipine inhibit both L and T-type channels. However, other mechanisms, including an effect on neuronal P/Q-type calcium channels (recently detected in arterioles), the microheterogeneity of vascular beds, and other types of calcium influx may also play a role. This article presents recent data about the expression and physiological role of calcium channels in arteries and the molecular targets of the calcium channel antagonists, particularly those exhibiting distinct renovascular effects.",0

We have assessed for the first time, the efficacy of melatonin alone and in combination with a sub-optimal dose of tamoxifen, a partial oestrogen antagonist, on N-nitroso-N-methylurea-induced rat mammary tumours. Both these agents were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats following excision of the primary tumours. Melatonin (200 micrograms/day/rat) at the given dose level could significantly suppress the appearance of second generation mammary tumours and the latency period of tumour appearance was also significantly increased (P < 0.001) as compared to vehicle-treated animals. Tamoxifen (60 micrograms/week/rat) does not suppress the development of second generation mammary tumours. Co-administration of melatonin and low dose of tamoxifen had no additive or synergistic effect on the prevention of second generation of mammary tumours. The results warrant the clinical evaluation of melatonin for chemoprevention and adjuvant therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.2527/1991.6962387x,Selection within and across populations in livestock improvement.,"Genetic evaluations within and across populations (countries, breeds, herds) allow ranking on estimated genetic merit and selecting breeding individuals across populations. Selection within and across populations (combined selection) should by definition always be as good as, or better than, within-population selection, the limiting case. The advantage depends on the sizes of the populations, the number of populations, the initial genetic means, and the correspondence of the breeding objectives in the different populations, as measured by the genetic correlation for economic merit. The advantages of combined selection are evaluated deterministically for a simple case of selecting the best males for use across populations by using a common truncation line over the distributions of EBV for the different populations. Combined selection increases overall response rates in the cooperating populations. Where the initial genetic means are the same, small populations (100 males tested) benefit greatly from combined selection. Large populations (500 to 1,000 males tested) also benefit, but less. The results depend on the increased selection response to scale, response being approximately linear with the logarithm of the number tested. When the initial means differ, the genetically poorer population can catch up in three to five generations and then contribute to the increased responses with combined selection. When breeding objectives differ, selection usually gradually pulls the populations apart and they make less and less contribution to each other and finally become separate. These results have implications for breeding strategies. Their application would affect structures of populations and rates of genetic change possible by selection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01644229,Clinical superinfection and its attendant symptomatic changes in pediatrics,"Studies were conducted on the effects of antibiotics on intestinal bacterial flora and symptomatic changes associated with possible superinfection following antibiotic treatment. Following the administration of oral antibiotics, there were no marked changes in the intestinal flora. After second and third-generation cephems were injected, most bacteria, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which is resistant to them, decreased and fungi increased. The incidences of diarrhea after administering oral antibiotics were high for amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. In some patients with depressed immunity, such as leukemic patients and neonates, decreases in intestinal bacteria after doses of antibiotics led to increases in pathogenic bacteria. They invaded the circulating blood, leading to septicemia. Septicemia originating in the intestinal tract was frequently associated with the development of vitamin K deficiency. Besides changes in the intestinal flora, a decrease in oral food intake and the presence of a methylthiotetrazole group in the structure of the administered antibiotics were also found to play a crucial role in causing vitamin K deficiency.",0

The contribution to chain length regulation of a beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, Cw KAS A1, derived from Cuphea wrightii, a species that accumulates 30% 10:0 and 54% 12:0 in seed oils, was investigated. Expression of Cw KAS A1 in Arabidopsis seeds reduced 16:0 from 8.2 to 6.2 mol%, suggesting a KAS II-type activity. In the presence of the KAS I inhibitor cerulenin, however, transgenic seed extracts extended 6:0- and 8:0-ACP at a rate four- to fivefold greater than extracts from untransformed plants, whereas no difference was observed in extension of 14:0- and 16:0-ACP. The effect of KAS A1 on seed oils was tested by combining it with the C. wrightii medium chain-specific thioesterases, Cw FatB1 and Cw FatB2, in crosses of transformed plants. Fatty acid synthesis thesis shifted towards shorter chains in progeny expressing both classes of enzymes. KasA1/FatB1 homozygotes produced threefold more 12:0 than the FatB1 parent while 14:0 and 16:0 were reduced by one-third and one-half, respectively. F2 progeny expressing KasA1 and FatB2 produced twofold more 10:0 and 1.4-fold more 12:0 than the FatB2 parent, and the double-transgenic progeny produced one-quarter less 14:0 and one-half less 16:0 than the FatB2 parent. It is hypothesized that the shift towards production of shorter chains resulted from increased pools of medium chain acyl-ACP resulting from KAS A1 activity. The combined activities of KAS A1 and FatB thioesterases appear to determine the C. wrightii phenotype.",0

By using RIBA-2, 92 (56.1%) were reactive, 64 (39%) were nonreactive, and 8 (4.9%) were indeterminate. By using RIBA-3, 98 (59.7%) were reactive 60 (36.6%) were nonreactive, and 6 (3.7%) were indeterminate. By using PCR, 108 (65.9%) were positive. Of the eight RIBA-2 indeterminate samples, seven became RIBA-3 reactive but PCR-positive, and one became RIBA-3 nonreactive but PCR-negative. Of the six RIBA-3 indeterminate samples, five were RIBA-2 nonreactive but PCR-positive, and one was RIBA-2 reactive but PCR-negative. From our study on Saudi patients, we conclude that RIBA-3 has slightly but not significantly improved the results of anti-HCV antibody detection, and is probably of more value to resolve those indeterminate samples by RIBA-2. Although expensive, PCR remains the most reliable HCV diagnostic method until an HCV antigen detection test is available.",0
,Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis: analysis on clinical features of thirty-two adult patients.,"To assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of adult Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) meningitis.Thirty-two adult patients with KP meningitis were included in this study. Their clinical features, the outcomes with the third generation cephalosporin (moxalactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime) treatment and prognostic factors were analyzed.These patients' diseases were predominantly community-acquired. Males outnumbered females (3:1). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most common underlying disease, followed by other debilitating diseases such as liver cirrhosis, neoplasm and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with spontaneous meningitis had a more fulminant course with a higher prevalence of bacteremia, shock and death (66%). Metastatic septic abscess was frequent (19%). Among the 21 patients who received initial appropriate antimicrobial therapy (IAAT), 2 took cefotaxime and 1 died; 13 took moxalactam of whom 5 died; and 6 took ceftazidime of whom 3 died. All of the other 11 patients who did not receive IAAT died.The clinical features of KP meningitis are various and indistinguishable from other form of bacteria meningitis. Most of the patients with KP meningitis are associated with underlying medical problems, such as diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis. Many factors, including septic shock, bacteremia, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration, and IAAT, might influence the prognosis. In spite of a high mortality rate, however, IAAT is mandatory to improve the overall survival rate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.1997.9976605,"Admission policy, patterns of migration and integration: The German and French case compared","Germany and France differ in their concepts of citizenship and nationality. Those differences have led to different patterns of immigration to the two countries and to different policies on the integration of migrants. The French notion of equality has led to the development and implementation of a migration policy designed to assimilate migrants to mainstream French culture. Citizenship is therefore granted more on the principle of jus soli, with differences in status groups not held to exist. However, Germany's interpretation of citizenship has been based upon descent, and immigration policy has focused upon groups which have German ethnic backgrounds. During the period of economic demand for foreign labor, Germany did not plan to have permanent immigration and considered the employment of foreign labor to be a temporary measure. Yet even when the arrival of immigrants with no German ethnic background is accepted, there are still major differences in the integration of different ethnic groups. While ethnic Germans are privileged because they have the right to citizenship upon arrival to German, and are also entitled to various integration measures, other immigrant groups may often not be granted citizenship, even in the case of second or third generations.",0

L’objectif de cette enquête nationale était de préciser ; à travers deux cohortes de patients adultes l’une « en phase aiguë » (prescription de loxapine dans les 4 semaines précédentes), l’autre dite « en phase de maintien » (prescription de loxapine depuis plus de 8 semaines), le profil clinique et thérapeutique de patients pris en charge par cet antipsychotique. La population recrutée (1 511 patients) présentait des données sociodémographiques identiques dans les deux groupes, les critères de sélection étaient adaptés aux données recueillies pour une analyse statistiquement pertinente soit 696 patients en phase aiguë et 633 patients en phase de maintien. Le groupe phase aiguë se composait de patients majoritairement connus (82 % d’antécédents psychotiques) sous forme de schizophrénie (47 %) ou de troubles de l’humeur (57 %), ayant déjà présenté des épisodes aigus (5,4 en moyenne) ; pour l’épisode actuel, la clinique était celle d’un état d’agitation (88 %), d’une durée moyenne de 15 jours ayant nécessité une hospitalisation (87 %), dont une hospitalisation sous contrainte (47,5 % en HDT et 40,8 % en HO) et une prescription de loxapine en monothérapie (56 %) à la dose moyenne quotidienne de 177,3 mg. Le groupe phase de maintien comprenait une population de patients connus (87,5 %), schizo-phrènes (63 %), présentant des symptômes psychotiques (dissociation 82 %, délire 74 %) ou thymiques (71 %) ayant nécessité une hospitalisation libre (78 %) sur une durée moyenne de 180 jours et une prescription de loxapine en monothérapie dans 28 % des cas à la dose moyenne quotidienne de 131,6 mg.

A retrospective observational pharmaco-epidemiological survey was conducted during 24 weeks between October 2004 and March 2005 in metropolitan France (384 investigators) to more clearly define the use of loxapine in acute and chronic psychotic states. The objective of this national survey was to specify the clinical and therapeutic profile of patients managed by this antipsychotic in two cohorts of adult patients : one in « acute phase » (prescription of loxapine during the previous 4 weeks), the other in « maintenance phase » (prescription of loxapine for more than 8 weeks). The two groups of the recruited population (1,511 patients) presented identical sociodemographic data. Selection criteria were adapted to the data collected to ensure statistically relevant analysis : 696 patients in acute phase and 633 patients in maintenance phase. The acute phase group was predominantly composed of known patients (82 % of patients had a psychotic history) with schizophrenia (47 %) or mood disorders (57 %) who had already presented acute episodes (an average of 5.4). The current episode consisted of a state of agitation (88 %) lasting an average of two weeks, requiring hospitalization (87 %), scheduled admission [HDT (admission at the request of another person) in 47.5 % of cases and HO (statutory admission) in 40.8 % of cases&rsqb; and prescription of loxapine monotherapy (56 %) at a mean daily dose of 177,3 mg.

A prospective study of 67 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia was carried out to determine the causative agents, the impact fore-knowledge of the etiology has on the outcome, the value of clinical and radiologic criteria in predicting the evolution, and the efficacy of empirical therapy. The study group included 45 men and 22 women (mean age: 56.8 +/- 16.6 yr), and 46.2% suffered from a concurrent debilitating disease. The cause of pneumonia was diagnosed in 32 cases, and the most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (37.5%), Legionella pneumophila (21.8%), and gram-negative bacilli (25.0%). The fact that fungal infections were present in three patients and Pneumocystis carinii in one are worthy of note. The overall death rate was 20.8%. A fatal outcome was related to the age of the patient (p less than 0.05), the presence of debilitating disease (p = 0.026), and septic shock (p = 0.0009). Diagnosis of the causative agents did not aid in increasing the survival rate, but it did allow for better patient management. Most of the patients (85.1%) initiated on treatment with erythromycin plus tobramycin recovered, but only 68.4% of the subjects commenced on treatment with other therapeutics survived. Furthermore, it was necessary to modify the therapy of a greater percentage of the latter group (p less than 0.025). Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia was a frequent finding among the patients who did not recover, making empirical treatment with erythromycin plus third generation cephalosporins most advisable for severe cases of community-acquired pneumonia.",0

Most studies on surgical procedures for cartilage focus on young patients because these procedures are generally not considered suitable for older patients.To analyze the clinical outcome of cartilage lesion treatment using second-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques in patients more than 40 years old with no clear signs of osteoarthritis, to understand their real potential in relation to aging, the failure rate, and complications in older patients.Case series; Level of evidence, 4.Sixty-one patients with grade III to IV cartilaginous lesions of the condyles with no clear signs of osteoarthritis and a minimum age of 40 years were treated with second-generation ACI and prospectively evaluated at 5 years' follow-up. Twenty-two patients were treated with arthroscopic Hyalograft C implantation, and 39 underwent the open Chondro-Gide MACI procedure.A significant improvement in both subjective and objective evaluations was observed. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score improved from 36.8 ± 8.4 to 68.1 ± 21.8 at the final evaluation. The failure rate was 20%. A faster improvement was observed in the group treated with the arthroscopic Hyalograft C technique, whereas similar scores were found at the 24-month follow-up and final evaluation.A clinical improvement was found in patients more than 40 years old, who in most cases benefited from second-generation ACI with good results lasting at medium-term follow-up. However, the results were inferior with respect to those previously found for younger populations, and the failure rate at medium-term follow-up was also higher. These findings were consistent in the 2 treatment groups. The only difference was the faster recovery when the arthroscopic approach was used.",0

Currently, the availability of first generation antipsychotic (FGA) formulations is limited to two high potency agents: haloperidol and fluphenazine. At Yale New-Haven Psychiatric Hospital, the hospital pharmacy was able to create perphenazine suspension, a mid-potency FGA, with a record of effectiveness and tolerability that was no worse than that of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in the CATIE trial. In this study we compare perphenazine suspension to other first and SGAs in the risk of extrapyramidal reactions and whether or not patients were continued on the same antipsychotic they were started with at the time of discharge. Medical records of patients who received acute pharmacotherapy in a unique form while hospitalized at Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital from July 2009 to December 2009 were examined. All data were collected thru a chart review using a form that was created to systematically document experiences. A total of 229 patients were included in the study. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on gender, age, race or diagnosis. In the entire samples 1.75% had pseudo-parkonisnism, 1.31% had acute dystonia, 0.04% had tardive dyskinesia, 1.31% akithesia, and 4.8% any neurological side effects. There were no significant differences between agents in the likelihood of any of these side effects or of having any side effect. Higher use of anticholinergics was found in patients treated with FGAs. We also found that 77% were discharged on the same antipsychotic agent they received when they were initially hospitalized. A wide range of acute oral pharmacoptherapy in non-tablet formulations of first and SGAs should be available in psychiatric hospital formularies. FGAs seems to be as well tolerated as SGAs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/09546630310012127,Photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy of cutaneous disease,"Photodynamic therapy is a rapidly developing treatment modality in dermatology. A sensitizer drug is activated by light in the presence of oxygen. This results in the release of reactive oxygen species that damage the target tissue. The ideal features of a photosensitizer are that it should be highly selective for lesional tissue, activated by light of a sufficiently long wavelength for tissue penetration, and have a high photodynamic yield (i.e. production of singlet oxygen). A short time interval between administration and its maximal accumulation in tumour tissue, followed by rapid tissue clearance, are also desirable. First-generation sensitizers were complex chemical mixtures, needing parenteral administration and causing troublesome and prolonged photosensitivity. A range of second-generation sensitizers of different chemical families show several advantages including purity, longer activation wavelength and less prolonged photosensitivity, but effective topical formulations have not been developed. Currently, the most convenient and widely practised form of PDT for cutaneous disorders is the topical application of the pro-drug delta-aminolevulinic acid or its methylated ester, which are activated by light following metabolism to the endogenous sensitizer protoporphyrin IX.",0

The first generation of transgenic cotton with B. thuringiensis produces a single toxin, Cry1Ac, that is highly effective against susceptible larvae of pink bollworm ( Pectinophora gossypiella ), a major cotton pest. To counter potential problems with resistance, second-generation transgenic cotton that produces B. thuringiensis toxin Cry2Ab alone or in combination with Cry1Ac has been developed. In greenhouse bioassays, a pink bollworm strain selected in the laboratory for resistance to Cry1Ac survived equally well on transgenic cotton with Cry1Ac and on cotton without Cry1Ac. In contrast, Cry1Ac-resistant pink bollworm had little or no survival on second-generation transgenic cotton with Cry2Ab alone or with Cry1Ac plus Cry2Ab. Artificial diet bioassays showed that resistance to Cry1Ac did not confer strong cross-resistance to Cry2Aa. Strains with &gt;90% larval survival on diet with 10 μg of Cry1Ac per ml showed 0% survival on diet with 3.2 or 10 μg of Cry2Aa per ml. However, the average survival of larvae fed a diet with 1 μg of Cry2Aa per ml was higher for Cry1Ac-resistant strains (2 to 10%) than for susceptible strains (0%). If plants with Cry1Ac plus Cry2Ab are deployed while genes that confer resistance to each of these toxins are rare, and if the inheritance of resistance to both toxins is recessive, the efficacy of transgenic cotton might be greatly extended.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cmmi.449,Recent advances in colloidal gold nanobeacons for molecular photoacoustic imaging,"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents a hybrid, nonionizing modality, which has been of particular interest because of its satisfactory spatial resolution and high soft tissue contrast. PAI has the potential to provide both functional and molecular imaging in vivo since optical absorption is sensitive to physiological parameters. In this review we summarize our effort to advance molecular PAI with colloidal gold nanobeacons (GNB). GNB represents a robust nanoparticle platform that entraps multiple copies of tiny gold nanoparticles (2-4 nm) within a larger colloidal particle encapsulated by biocompatible synthetic or natural amphilines. The utilization of numerous small gold particles greatly amplifies the signal without exceeding the renal elimination threshold size. With fibrin-targeted GNB, the robust detection of microthrombus formed over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque has been achieved, which offers an important opportunity to recognize patients with moderate lumen stenosis but high risk of stroke. With the use of second-generation smaller GNBs, the potential to improve sentinel lymph node assessment and biopsy was advanced with respect to rapidity and sensitivity of detection in mice. Finally, for angiogenesis, an essential microanatomical biomarker of tumor and cardiovascular disease progression, integrin-targeted GNBs allowed visualization of numerous angiogenic sprouts and bridges that were otherwise undetectable from inherent blood signal alone, offering sensitive and specific discrimination and quantification of angiogenesis in vivo.",0

The A/WySnJ mouse, but not the related A/J strain, has disturbed homeostasis leading to peripheral B-lymphocyte deficiency. B lymphopoeisis is normal in A/WySnJ mice, but the B cells apoptose rapidly in the periphery. This B cell-intrinsic defect segregated as a single locus, Bcmd, in (A/WySnJ×A/J)F2 mice. Here we mapped a quantitative-trait locus (QTL) that contributes to the A/WySnJ B-cell deficiency by examining the F2 progeny of a cross between strains A/WySnJ and CAST/Ei. In this cross, minimally 1.9 QTLs controlling peripheral B lymphocyte deficiency segregated. The (A/WySnJ×CAST/Ei)F2 mice were phenotyped for splenic B-cell percentage and the DNA from progeny with extreme phenotypes was used to map the QTL by the simple-sequence length polymorphism method. A genome scan showed linkage between peripheral B-cell deficiency and Chromosome (Chr) 15 markers. When closely spaced Chr 15 markers were analyzed, the 99% confidence interval for the QTL map position extended along the entire chromosome length. The peak lod scores >17 occurred between 30 and 45 cM. We conclude that a significant QTL segregating in (A/WySnJ×CAST/Ei)F2 mice resides in this middle region of Chr 15.",0

An important public health issue is the extent to which Canadian women are engaging in regular screening for cervical cancer, particularly potentially at-risk groups such as recent immigrants and women from minority ethnic backgrounds. We use recent population health surveys to analyze immigrant and native-born women’s use of Pap smear testing, with a focus on how screening rates differ by ethnic background and characteristics of immigration. We find that almost all recent immigrant women have markedly lower use of Pap smear testing than comparable Canadian-born women, but these rates slowly increase with years in Canada. However, we find wide variation in rates of screening by ethnic background. Screening rates for White immigrant women from countries where the official language is neither English nor French approach Canadian-born women’s utilization rates after 15–20 years in Canada, as do the screening rates of Black and Hispanic women. Screening rates for those from Asian backgrounds remain significantly below native-born Canadian levels even after many years in Canada. As well, immigrant women of Asian background who arrived as children and second-generation Asian Canadians both exhibit significantly lower rates of Pap smear testing than Canadian-born White women.",0
https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.112.7.1085,Mitotic control in the absence of cdc25 mitotic inducer in fission yeast,"Fission yeast cells tolerate the total absence of the cdc25 mitotic inducer in two cases, either in cdc2-3w or in wee1 genetic backgrounds. In the cdc2-3w cdc25Delta double mutant, the rate-limiting step leading to mitosis is reaching a critical size. However, the size control of this mutant operates in late G2, which is different from wild-type (WT) cells. This fact suggests that in WT the rate-limiting molecular process during the G2 timer is the Tyr15 dephosphorylation of cdc2, for which the cdc25 phosphatase (together with its back-up, pyp3) is dependent. In the wee1-50 cdc25Delta mutant, the population splits into different clusters, all lacking mitotic size control. This strain maintains size homeostasis by a novel method, which is random movement of the cells from one cluster to another in the successive generations. These cells should normally have a ‘minimal cycle’, a ‘timer’ with short G1 and G2 phases. However, very often the cells abort mitosis, possibly at an early event and return back to early G2, thus lengthening their cycles. The inability of these cells to start anaphase might be caused by the absence of the main mitotic regulators (wee1 and cdc25) and the improper regulation of their back-up copies (mik1 and pyp3, respectively).",0

Two of these, proquazone (SaH 43-715, Biarsan, Biarison) and fluproquazone (SaH 46-790), are clinically effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and phenylbutazone were included for reference as first and second generation nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), respectively. In general, substitutions in these five quinazolinone analogs produced noticeable changes in potency in several activities but changes of lesser degrees in others.

,[The production and multi-color genomic in situ hybridization identification of maize-Z. perennis substituted material].,"Genus Zea. L was composed of two sections: sect. Luxuriantes Doebley & Iltis including Z. dipperennis, Z. luxurians and Z. perennis, and sect. Zea. mays consisting only one species, annual Z. mays. To improve the biodiversity of germ-plasm in maize breeding, the study of transferring maize relatives gene into common maize were performed. Firstly, interspecific hybrids between maize (Zea. L) (2n = 20) and Z. perennis (2n = 40) were produced with the aim of transferring desirable horticultural traits from Z. perennis to maize. The F1 of maize x Z. perennis (2n = 30) plant had the most frequent configuration of 5 III + 5 II + 5 I, which were sterile and difficult to produce progeny because of genomic affinities. However,few F2 individuals of maize x Z. perennis could be obtained by some specially treatments, and one maize-like F2 plant were obtained, which were used as a female parent in backcrossing with maize parent. Twelve F2 x P1 ( BC1 F2 ) plants were obtained and then self-crossed to produce self-crossing generation of F2 x P1 (2n = 20) ( BC1 F3). The phenotypic characters of parents, F1 (2n = 30) hybrids, F2 and F2 x P1 were investigated, such as plant height, flowering, leaf shape and tillers. To further verify the genomic organization of maize-Z. perennis material, maize (inbred line 48-2) and BC1 F3 chromosomes, the root tip cells were analyzed by Multi-color GISH. We probed maize and BC1 F3 chromosomes with the probe mixture containing biotin-labeled Z. perennis genomic DNA and digoxigenin-labeled maize genomic DNA, the maize spread exhibited 10 chromosomes with yellow signals and the other 10 chromosomes carried green fluorescing bands. However, although the BC1 F3 was 2n = 20 in all cases. Multi-color GISH images revealed that 17 chromosomes had uniform signals similar to maize chromosomes, but dispersed red signals over the remaining three chromosomes were observed, which indicated that the 3 chromosomes originated from Z. perennis, and they were smaller than maize chromosomes. Data obtained from multi-color GISH images indicated that BC1 F3 was probably a substituted material from maize-Z. perennis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1310/tsr1401-65,Do Hispanic Children Need to Know About Stroke Prevention?,"When compared to Hispanics in their native countries, the frequency of stroke in the Hispanic American population is higher. This has been linked to an increase in smoking, inactivity, and obesity. Initially these health issues were thought to affect only Hispanic adults, but research confirms that first- and second-generation adolescents and young adults continue to demonstrate these habits. Education has been shown to be an effective method of stroke prevention by increasing an individual's knowledge base. As demonstrated in a previous study performed in the Hispanic community, when educational material is presented in a familiar environment and offers lifestyle options that are culturally realistic, there is an increase in knowledge and compliance with lifestyle changes. The focus of education for stroke prevention has always been placed on older adults, but little has been done to alter the cultural risk factors found in the young adult and adolescent population in order to prevent stroke in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.088229,Inducible mouse models illuminate parameters influencing epigenetic inheritance,"Environmental factors can stably perturb the epigenome of exposed individuals and even that of their offspring, but the pleiotropic effects of these factors have posed a challenge for understanding the determinants of mitotic or transgenerational inheritance of the epigenetic perturbation. To tackle this problem, we manipulated the epigenetic states of various target genes using a tetracycline-dependent transcription factor. Remarkably, transient manipulation at appropriate times during embryogenesis led to aberrant epigenetic modifications in the ensuing adults regardless of the modification patterns, target gene sequences or locations, and despite lineage-specific epigenetic programming that could reverse the epigenetic perturbation, thus revealing extraordinary malleability of the fetal epigenome, which has implications for ‘metastable epialleles’. However, strong transgenerational inheritance of these perturbations was observed only at transgenes integrated at the Col1a1 locus, where both activating and repressive chromatin modifications were heritable for multiple generations; such a locus is unprecedented. Thus, in our inducible animal models, mitotic inheritance of epigenetic perturbation seems critically dependent on the timing of the perturbation, whereas transgenerational inheritance additionally depends on the location of the perturbation. In contrast, other parameters examined, particularly the chromatin modification pattern and DNA sequence, appear irrelevant.",1

The technique is based on a second generation wavelet transform and level-dependent threshold estimator. Here, wavelet coefficients of ECG signals were obtained with lifting-based wavelet filters. A lifting scheme is used to construct second-generation wavelets and is an alternative and faster algorithm for a classical wavelet transform. The overall denoising performance of our proposed method is considered in relation to several measuring parameters, including types of wavelet filters (Haar, Daubechies 4 (DB4), Daubechies 6 (DB6), Filter(9-7), and Cubic B-splines), thresholding method, and decomposition depth. Three different kinds of noise were considered in this work: muscle artifact noise, electrode motion artifact noise, and white noise. Global performance is evaluated by means of the signal-to-noise ratio and visual inspection. Numerical results comparing the performance of the proposed method with that of nonlinear filtering techniques (median filter) are given. The results demonstrate consistently superior denoising performance of the proposed method over median filtering.",0
,[Familial cleft lip with or without coexisting cleft palate].,"Etiopatology of clefts has not been explained yet. It is assumed that the cause of this defect is complex and heterogeneous. Genes which induce the incidence of cleft have not been detected too but clinical observations indicate a familial predisposition. At the Plastic Surgery Clinic of the Łódz Medical Academy, on years 1972-2001, 3180 children with cleft lip or/and palate were being treated. The group under examination consisted of 540 children with positive family histories. Two genetic groups were confirmed and each of them with a different risk of the reoccurrence of the defect. The first group--cleft lip and palate, the second group--an isolated cleft palate. A correlation between the type of cleft and a child's sex and its cleft affected parent was found. Among children of mothers with cleft lip there were 60% of boys and only 15% of girls with the same type of cleft. In mothers with cleft lip and palate the same type of cleft has been detected in 70% of boys and 18% girls. Similar results were obtained when affected fathers were taken into account. However, in case of mothers and fathers who were affected with isolated cleft palate there were significantly more girls than boys who had cleft palate. An in-depth study of cleft inheritance mechanisms will make in the future a more precise prediction of the occurrence of the defect in consecutive generations possible. Perhaps, the chance to work out cleft preventions will emerge and the gathered data will be taken advantage of in genetic counselling.",0

The number of univalents varied from 0 to 8. The reduction of chromosomes in the hybrid and the high numbers of bivalents were possibly due to the chromosome of Crambe abyssinica eliminating and the genome of Brassica. Chinensis doubling in the hybrid cells. Triade cells, chromosome lagging, and chromosome bridges were observed in anaphase II.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2172-5-14,,"Congenic strains of mice are assumed to differ only at a single gene or region of the genome. These mice have great importance in evaluating the function of genes. However, their utility depends on the maintenance of this true congenic nature. Although, accumulating evidence suggests that congenic strains suffer genetic divergence that could compromise interpretation of experimental results, this problem is usually ignored. During coinfection studies with Salmonella typhimurium and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-congenic mice, we conducted the proper F2 controls and discovered significant differences between these F2 animals and MHC-genotype-matched P0 and F1 animals in weight gain and pathogen load. To systematically evaluate the apparent non-MHC differences in these mice, we infected all three generations (P0, F1 and F2) for 5 MHC genotypes (b/b, b/q and q/q as well as d/d, d/q, and q/q) with Salmonella and TMEV.Infected P0 MHC q/q congenic homozygotes lost significantly more weight (p = 0.02) and had significantly higher Salmonella (p < 0.01) and TMEV (p = 0.02) titers than the infected F2 q/q homozygotes. Neither weight nor pathogen load differences were present in sham-infected controls.These data suggest that these strains differ for genes other than those in the MHC congenic region. The most likely explanation is that deleterious recessive mutations affecting response to infection have accumulated in the more than 40 years that this B10.Q-H-2q MHC-congenic strain has been separated from its B10-H-2b parental strain. During typical experiments with congenic strains, the phenotypes of these accumulated mutations will be falsely ascribed to the congenic gene(s). This problem likely affects any strains separated for appreciable time and while usually ignored, can be avoided with the use of F2 segregants.",0

Of the 15706 episodes, 95% were outpatient office episodes. The outpatient episodes were accounted for by 8784 patients and 946 physicians.Use of antibiotics in URI episodes. Proportionate costs and costs per episode were computed based on claims paid by Medicaid.Sixty percent of outpatient episodes and 48% of emergency department episodes resulted in an antibiotic prescription being filled. In outpatient settings, episodes in which secondary diagnoses of either otitis media or acute sinusitis were found accounted for less than 6% of the episodes that resulted in an antibiotic prescription being filled. The most frequently filled antibiotic was amoxicillin, although second- and third-generation cephalosporins were the second most frequently occurring antibiotic class. Twenty-three percent and 9% of outpatient and emergency department episodes, respectively, resulted in a prescription filled for antihistamines. In outpatient episodes, antibiotics account for 23% of the total cost of care. In emergency department visits, antibiotics account for 8% of the cost of URIs. Antibiotics cost, on average, $9.91 for each episode of care in outpatient office visits. An estimate of the cost of antibiotics for URIs in a year for the Kentucky Medicaid program is $1.62 million.The results indicate that a substantial proportion of resources in Medicaid are being used for nonindicated and ineffective treatments for URIs. With the increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens and shrinking public health care funding, the current treatment for URIs should be reexamined.",0

Some of these rabbits were under the examination 50 to 365 days after an additional treatment with alloxan was employed. The following results were demonstrated, comparing with the data from control rabbits with or without alloxanization. a) In the rabbits born from the sicked parents an increase in amount of 17-KS and II, III, VI, VII fractions were observed. The increase became more apparent with the successive mating generations and it was very marked in after the fourth generation in which spontaneous diabetes developed. b) Amounts of 17-KS and its II, III, VI, VII fractions in the intact rabbits became under the normal levels when diabetes developed after administration of alloxan. c) Amounts of 17-KS and its II, III, VI, VII fractions excreted in the urine in the rabbits born from the sicked parents up to the second generation showed a decrease after alloxan administration, which were larger than those excreted in the urine of the alloxanized control rabbits and which were smaller than those of normal rabbits. However, in the rabbits from the sicked parents from the third to the fifth generations of the successive mating, a decrease in amounts of 17-KS and its II, III, VI, VII fractions was resulted from alloxanization, remaining at the level above normal ranges. Measurement of a total amounts of 17-KS and its fractions, FGS and uropepsin were made on the following animals (I) the first group, Wistar rats with spontaneous diabetes in both sexes born from the spontaneous diabetic parents, at definite intervals of time from the weanling age to approximately 120 days of age. (2) the second group, some of the male rats of the first group, exposed to alloxanization when the animals showed negative urine sugar. The following results were obtained, comparing with the data from normal rats with or without alloxanization. a) In Wistar rats of the first group, larger amounts of 17-KS and its II, III, VI, VII fractions, FGS and uropepsin were excreted in the urine than those in the normal rats during a full course of maturation and aging since weanling age. b) In normal rats with alloxanization, an increase in amount of the metabolites mentioned herein observed 10 days after the treatment was followed by a persistent decrease. c) The male rats in the second group, alloxanization also resulted in a temporary increase in the urinary amounts, subsequently followed by a decrease, continuing for at least 3 months, amounts in the decreasing stages still being remained in over normal ranges. The following conclusions may be obtained from the results mentioned above : 1) In the offspring rabbits and Wistar rats born from diabetic parents, the hyperfunction of the adrenal cortex can be observed, the degree of which being gradually more apparent with successive mating generations. 2) The hypofunction of the adrenal cortex can be developed in the animals when rabbits and Wistar rats were became diabetic by application of alloxan. 3) The offsprsng animals born from the diabetic parents, when alloxanization is employed, show various function states, from hyper- to hypo-function to less extent, corresponding to the generation number of the successive mating.",1

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of genetic point mutations in CL/P pathogenesis. ICR and AJ strain mice were used. Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) was injected into 10-week-old male mice (G0) intraperitoneally at a dose of 250 mg/kg. The males were bred with two untreated virgin females of the same strain on day 100 after injection. The uterine contents (G1) of one female were examined on day 18.5 of pregnancy. From the other female, the offspring were delivered naturally, and F3 mice (G3) were also examined in the same way. In ICR strain mice, cleft palate only (CPO) was increased in both the G1 and G3. The frequency was significantly higher in the G3 than the G1 generation. Cleft lip was not observed. In AJ strain mice, CL/P increased in both the G1 and G3. In the G3, the frequency of CPO was increased significantly. Genes related to CPO may be recessive in phenotype. CPO and cleft lip differ from a genetic viewpoint. Point mutations play a significant role in cleft lip and palate.",1

,"Resolution on the population and food equation and the search for rational and efficient solutions to the problem of Third World debt to ensure that the world can eat, 9 September 1989.","In September 1989, the 82nd Inter-Parliamentary Conference passed a resolution ""on the population and food equation and the search for rational and efficient solutions to the problem of Third World debt to ensure that the world can eat."" This document contains major portions of that resolution. In the area of population, the resolution affirms family planning (FP) as a basic human right and affirms the right of governments to establish their own population policies. Governments are asked to provide the educational opportunities necessary to secure equality and rights for women. Service delivery systems should be improved to make FP accessible to the 300 million women in need. Governments should reduce infant and maternal mortality, promote child care and birth spacing, and increase population education activities. The resolution also states that the creation of peaceful conditions for development is an essential precondition for solving the world's problems. In the area of food, the eradication of hunger is designated one of the primary tasks of the international community. This will only occur when developing countries increase their food production and achieve self-sufficiency. Such action is a basic and primary responsibility of developing countries but creditor nations can provide low interest rates for food import assistance and funds to strengthen the agricultural sector. The resolution further considers the problem of developing country debt and deplores coercive measures applied by certain developed countries against developing countries. The resolution contains many suggestions for reducing debt in developing countries and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth in the world. In the area of food resources and sustainable development, the resolution acknowledges that protection of the environment and the earth's resource base for future generations is a collective responsibility. Ecological threats to the production of food should be dealt with, industrialized countries should decrease consumption of natural resources, and food production should be ecologically sound.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/17.suppl_e.55,The future of thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,"The ability of thrombolytic therapy to lower mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction was first demonstrated in 1986 by the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico. In the ensuing 10 years, large efforts have been undertaken to develop more effective and safer thrombolytic agents. In addition, the value of adjunctive agents influencing thrombotic and thrombolytic processes was demonstrated, and newer agents are under active investigation. This review focuses on theoretical and practical aspects of optimizing thrombolytic therapy and on genetically engineered third generation plasminogen activators. Optimized thrombolytic therapy may make this form of therapy available to patients who are currently considered ineligible, and it will lead to earlier, more complete reperfusion of infarct-related coronary arteries. The benefits and risks of optimized thrombolytic regimens relative to those of mechanical reperfusion strategies will require constant reassessment while both forms of treatment develop.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/00918360902728764,Sexual Coercion Among Gay and Bisexual Men in Aotearoa/New Zealand,"Until recently, sexual coercion among gay men has been regarded as virtually oxymoronic. Discourses of male sexuality as ever-present and driven, and discourses of masculinity that portray men as in control and invulnerable, converge to almost disavow the possibilities that sex could be unwanted by men, or that men could be vulnerable to being pressured into sex against their will. This article reports on interviews with 19 gay and bisexual men about their experiences of forced, coerced, or unwanted sex. We identified four general patterns in these accounts: (1) incidents involving physical force; (2) experiences in which a man's ability to refuse sex was compromised by intoxication; (3) dynamics where young and inexperienced men were coerced or pressured into unwanted sex; and (4) situations in which men felt obligated to engage in unwanted sex. Specific issues included barriers to reporting sexual assault, power dynamics in intergenerational sex, and the difficulty of refusing unwanted sex. Importantly, many of the factors identified as driving sexual coercion relate not to gay sexuality per se, but rather to masculine sexuality. Conversely, some of the factors relating to men's vulnerability to coercion were exacerbated by some features of gay sexual culture; in particular those aspects associated with existing in a marginalized territory within a wider heteronormative context.",0

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta. Compound 24 was selected as the development candidate for the treatment of BPH.",0
,Pneumocephalus caused by neonatal Enterobacter cloacae infection in a case,"Objective Gas-containing encephalo-meningitis is very rare. There have only been a few cases reported in the literature. The majority of neonatal cases reported in literature died. We report a case of a 5-day-old neonate who developed diffuse pneumocephalus from Enterobacter cloacae septicemia and intracranial infection. Method This neonate was initially treated with penicillin and mezlocillin. He also received phototherapy, intravenous infusion, correction of acidosis and other supportive therapy. Complete blood count, C-Reactive protein, cranial CT scan, blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid culture and biochemistry were tested repeatedly. Results This neonate's condition deteriorated after admission. He developed respiratory distress, increased muscle tone and decreased level of consciousness. His WBC and C-reactive protein were elevated, while blood gas, electrolytes, liver enzymes and renal function were within normal range initially. Cranial CT scan was done which demonstrated diffuse pneumocephalus. He was transferred to a higher level hospital for further management at the request of the family. Blood culture done in our hospital subsequently showed growth of Enterobacter cloacae. The infant developed seizures and further deterioration in level of consciousness after transfer. Antibiotics were switched to penicillin and ceftizoxime. Cranial CT scan repeated 2 days after transfer showed hydrocephalus and some resolution of pneumocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was aspirated from the lateral ventricles two weeks after admission. CSF culture also showed growth of Enterobacter cloacae. Antibiotic was switched to imipenem according to antibiotic sensitivity. His general condition was improved. Blood and CSF cultures were negative 1 month after admission. His head circumference at discharge was 34.6 cm. Repeat cranial CT scan at 4 month of age demonstrated severe hydrocephalus, diffuse leukomalacia and calcification. This infant suffered significant neurodevelopmental deficit. Muscle tone was diffusely increased. Head circumference at 9 month of age was 48.4 cm. Conclusion This case suggests the importance of Enterobacter cloacae infection in the newborns. Our analysis of 34 cases of Enterobacter cloacae infection showed that 93.75% - 100% were sensitive to quinolones, 94.12% were sensitive to imipenem, 73.33% were sensitive to gentamicin, 50% were sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam. Enterobacter cloacae is generally not sensitive to penicillin, first and second generation cephalosporins (0 - 21.4%). Enterobacter cloacae septicemia and intracranial infection in neonates have a high mortality rate and can result in severe neurodevelopmental deficit in survivors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0143-4160(92)90007-f,"Effect of lysophospholipids, arachidonic acid and other fatty acids on regulation of Ca2+ transport in permeabilized pancreatic islets","The immediate reaction products of PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids were tested for their ability to induce Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores in permeabilized ob/ob mouse pancreatic islets. Lysophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids increased the free Ca2+ concentration in the incubation medium of permeabilized ob/ob mouse pancreatic islets. The potency of the lysophospholipids decreased in the following order: lysophosphatidylcholine = lysophosphatidylglycerol much greater than lysophosphatidylinositol greater than lysophosphatidylserine much greater than lysophosphatidylethanolamine. Arachidonic acid and palmitoleic acid had a potency comparable to lysophosphatidylinositol, while palmitic acid was ineffective. The Ca(2+)-mobilizing effect of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in permeabilized islet cells was additive to the lysophospholipid effect, indicating different sites of action. Both Ca(2+)-mobilizing effects were counteracted by the polyamine spermine, while the presence of Mg2+ shifted the Ca2+ concentrations to higher levels. Since not only an activation of a phospholipase C but also an activation of a phospholipase A2 with subsequent generation of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids is reported to occur in glucose-induced insulin secretion, the interaction of the phospholipase C reaction product IP3 with a lysophospholipid or an unsaturated fatty acid may affect the extent and duration of the rise in the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration responsible for initiation of insulin secretion.",0

This study assessed the genetic contribution to impulsivity and aggressiveness in a social context using a nonhuman primate model.Subjects were 352 adolescent and adult vervet monkeys from an extended multigenerational pedigree. Behavior was assessed in the Intruder Challenge Test, a standardized test that measures impulsivity and aggressiveness toward a stranger. Genetic and maternal contributions to variation in the Social Impulsivity Index and its two subscales, impulsive approach and aggression, were estimated using variance components analyses.The results found significant genetic contributions to social impulsivity (h2 =.35 +/-.11) and to each of the subscales, with no significant influence of maternal environment. There was a high genetic correlation between the impulsive approach and aggression subscales (rho =.78 +/-.12).This is the first study to demonstrate heritability of social impulsivity in adolescents and adults for any nonhuman primate species. The high genetic correlation suggests the same genes may influence variation in both impulsive approach and aggression. These results provide a promising basis for identification of susceptibility loci for impulsivity and aggressiveness.",0

Use of immunotherapy during remission is a potential approach to increase survival. We propose to develop cell vaccines by genetic modification of AML cells with CD80, an essential T cell costimulator that is lacking in the majority of AML cases, and GM-CSF, to induce proliferation and activation of professional antigen-presenting cells. Here, we evaluated third generation self inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors, which have the potential advantage of improved safety. CD80 and GM-CSF expression by these vectors was higher than that reported with second generation vectors (Stripecke et al, Blood 2000; 96: 1317-1326). In some cases, endogenous GM-CSF expression by transduced AML cells induced phenotypic changes consistent with the maturation of leukemia blasts into antigen-presenting cells. Further, in all cases studied, GM-CSF expression was associated with higher proliferation and cell viability. Allogeneic and autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions performed with transduced irradiated AML cells expressing CD80 and/or GM-CSF demonstrated that expression of either transgene enhanced T cell activation. These pre-clinical data demonstrate the potential feasibility of third generation SIN vectors for use in AML immunotherapy.",0

https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2010.11.007,The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers in Clinical Trials of Treatment Response in Cancer,"Current standard-of-care radiological methods for assessing the response of solid tumors to treatment are based on measuring changes in lesion size in a single dimension using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Even if size measurements are adapted to record true volume changes more accurately, the effects of therapeutic drugs on tumor size may not occur for several cycles of treatment. Furthermore, current and future generations of anticancer drugs will be designed to affect highly specific cancer characteristics, and their effects may not be immediately cytotoxic. More sensitive and specific measures are required that can report on tumor status and treatment response early in the course of therapy. Several MRI techniques have matured to the point where they can offer quantitative information on tissue status and greater insight into specific biophysical and physiological characteristics of tumors. Here we review and provide illustrative examples of two MRI methods that have already been incorporated into clinical trials of treatment response in solid tumors: diffusion imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. We also discuss the limitations and future research directions required for these techniques to gain greater acceptance and to have their maximum impact.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2002.00072.x,"The lifecycle effects of nutrition and body size on adult adiposity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease","This study was undertaken to review the links between maternal nutrition, offspring's birth weight and the propensity to early insulin resistance and high diabetes rates in Indian adults. Studies included a comparison of maternal size and nutrition with birth weights in Pune, India, and Southampton, UK. In Pune, the growth, insulin resistance and blood pressure of four-year-old children were assessed. Adults >40 years of age, who were resident in rural areas, were compared with adults living in urban areas for size, glucose handling, lipid status and blood pressure. Newly diagnosed diabetic adults living in urban areas were also monitored. Height, weight, head, waist and hip circumferences, skin-fold measurements and blood pressure were routinely measured. Fasting glucose, insulin, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were linked to the glucose and insulin responses during glucose tolerance tests. Cytokine levels were measured in plasma samples of urban and rural adults. Indian babies were lighter, thinner, shorter and had a relatively lower lean tissue mass than the Caucasian babies. However, the subcutaneous fat measurements of these babies were comparable to those of the white Caucasian babies. The Indian mothers were small, but relatively fat mothers produced larger babies. Maternal intake of green vegetables, fruit and milk, and their circulating folate and vitamin C levels, predicted larger fetal size. Rapid childhood growth promoted insulin resistance and higher blood pressure. Rural adults were thin, with a 4% prevalence of diabetes and a 14% prevalence of hypertension, but the risks increased within the normal body mass index (BMI) range. Type 2 diabetes was common in urban adults younger than 35 years of age. Although the average BMI was 23.9 kg m(-2), central obesity and thin limbs were noteworthy. Levels of interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-a were markedly increased in urban dwellers. Hence, there is evidence of a remarkably powerful, intergenerational effect on body size and total and central adiposity. Indians are highly susceptible to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risks, with babies being born small but relatively fat. Insulin resistance is amplified by rapid childhood growth. Dietary factors seem to have profound long-term metabolic influences in pregnancy. Overcrowding with infections and central obesity may amplify cytokine-induced insulin resistance and early diabetes in Indian adults with a low BMI.",0

DLS and TEM measurements revealed the size of PAMAM-PEG-WGA-Tf was in the range of 14-20 nm. It reduced the cytotoxicity of DOX to the normal cells greatly, while efficiently inhibited the growth rate of the C6 glioma cells. The assay of transport across the BBB showed that PAMAM-PEG-WGA-Tf delivered 13.5% of DOX in a period of 2 h, demonstrating an enhanced transport ratio as compared to the ratio of 8% for PAMAM-PEG-WGA, 7% for PAMAM-PEG-Tf and 5% for free DOX in the same period of time. The accumulation of DOX in the tumor site was increased due to the targeting effects of both Tf and WGA, leading to the complete breakage of the avascular C6 glioma spheroids in vitro.",0
,A test of the hypothesis that age at onset in Huntington disease is controlled by an X-linked recessive modifier.,"Data from the Research Roster for Huntington Disease Patients and Families were used to assess the hypothesis that juvenile onset in Huntington disease is determined by an X-linked recessive modifying gene in the affected parent. The observed proportion of affected fathers to affected mothers who had such offspring was not compatible with this hypothesis. Furthermore, neither the excess of affected grandfathers nor the existence of juvenile-onset and adult-onset cases within a sibship would be predicted by this model. We also rejected a more general hypothesis that a major change in gene expression across generations, measured by the presence of juvenile onset and/or major anticipation, is determined by an X-linked modifier. However, the inheritance of a propensity toward juvenile onset via the affected male line could be due to an abnormal pattern of paternal genomic imprinting.",0

Learning to create integrated and collegial relationships with people from different generations is a critical skill for nurses who work in multigenerational teams. This article will begin with a review of the historical perspective of the four generational cohorts currently in the workplace. This review will set a foundation for understanding each generation's unique set of work and personal values. Then the article will discuss various sources of multigenerational misunderstandings and conclude with a discussion of approaches to strengthen intergenerational work teams. The article will emphasize that learning to appreciate the diverse points of view, leverage the strengths, and value the differences in colleagues from various generations can enable individuals to form creative, adaptable, and cohesive work groups.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2052.2001.00796.x,Predictors of marker-informativeness for an outbred F2design,"Generalization of the polymorphism information content (PIC) index to represent marker informativeness (MI) for a three-generation F2 design requires that two additional sources of non-informativeness be added to the PIC formula: the probability of matings between like-heterozygous F1 individuals, of which one is non-informative; and that of matings between like-heterozygous F1 individuals, which are both fully informative but where line of origin of the same alleles is reciprocal. Given the dense marker-maps currently available for some species, this F2 informativeness parameter constitutes the natural criterion for marker selection in F2 designs, and two computer programs to predict MI from grandparental marker-genotypes were developed for an F2 population originating from two divergent selection lines of outbred mice (F approximately 0.2). A total of 403 markers had been genotyped for the F0 grandparents (n=31), and 14 markers had also been genotyped in the complete pedigree including 559 F2 individuals. One program was based on assumptions of random-mating (RM), while the other (PED) accounted for the pedigreed mating structure. For the 403 markers, the correlation between MI from RM and from PED was 0.95, and the average deviation between the two predictions was 0.005 MI units (MI ranged from 0 to 1). Correlations between predicted and realized MI for the 14 fully genotyped markers were 0.97 for PED and 0.94 for RM, while the corresponding average of deviations between predicted and actual values were 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. Absolute deviations from realized MI never exceeded 0.09 and 0.16 for PED and RM, respectively. Simulated optimization of the mating system to maximize average MI of 28 markers on one chromosome led to improvements in the range of 15-20% average MI (0.07-0.09 MI units). The degree of relative advantage conferred by the F2 generalization of the PIC index over the traditional index was found to be of minor significance.",0

The results were compared with those of either the conventional assay (anti-HCV first generation) or HCV-RNA analysis. With the first generation assay, anti-HCV was detected in 69% of post-transfusion acute hepatitis (AH), 44% of sporadic AH, 50% of needlestick exposed AH, 72% of chronic hepatitis (CH), 77% of liver cirrhosis (LC) and 86% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These results were remarkably increased by using the second generation assay (92% in post-transfusion AH, 72% in sporadic AH, 100% in needlestick exposed AH, 96% in CH, 96% in LC and 97% in HCC). Furthermore, in the early stages of AH (from 1-5 weeks after onset), anti-HCV was not detected in all 18 patients by the first generation assay, but was found in 10 of them by using the second generation assay. The failure to detect anti-HCV with the first generation assay was mainly due to a lack of the core region coding peptide (C22-3) in this assay. In the AH-resolving group, anti-HCV second generation did not disappear, but the titre tended to be lower than that in the CH-developing group. Thus, the second generation assay for anti-HCV was considered to be a more useful tool for not only the diagnosis of hepatitis C but also for determining prognosis.",0

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2605.2002.00372.x,Sperm DNA damage and cancer treatment1,"Cancer treatments are well known to adversely affect male fertility. Reduction of sperm output arises from the cytotoxic effects of chemo- or radiotherapy upon the spermatogenic epithelium. However, if the epithelium survives there is a hazard to reproduction as the treatments are also mutagenic. The presence of DNA damage in the male genome is shown in animal experiments where there is transgenerational expression as a variety of effects ranging from miscarriage to carcinogenesis. The application of DNA damage methodology to sperm provides the opportunity for direct assessment. The Comet and Chromatin structure assays (SCSA) measure DNA damage by different principles, however, conclusions arising from the data are similar. DNA damage is present in sperm from fertile and infertile men and there is some association with infertility. Both assays detect sperm DNA damage after in vivo treatment with genotoxic agents. In a man treated with chemotherapy for cancer there was increased and persistent DNA damage in sperm. This information is consistent with the generation of human genetic diseases after conception with sperm carrying high loads of DNA damage. Whilst studies have not supported any association between paternal cytotoxic cancer therapy and genetic disease in their children, it would be unwise to discount these observations. The institution of better surveillance of genetic disease in the offspring of men surviving cytotoxic therapies may provide more robust risk assessment.",0

https://doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-94.1.291,Seasonal Movement and Distribution of the Grape Mealybug (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae): Developing a Sampling Program for San Joaquin Valley Vineyards,"The grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Ehrhorn), is an important pest of table grapes in California's San Joaquin Valley. The mealybug causes direct damage by infesting grape bunches, resulting in very low economic injury levels. To develop a sampling program to help growers predict damage and make control decisions, we destructively sampled six entire grapevines each month to determine mealybug abundance and within-vine distribution. These absolute counts were then used to evaluate several relative sampling methods: sticky tape barriers on canes, excised spur samples, standard-sized pieces of bark, timed counts, and nondestructive counts on spurs. At midseason we sampled additional vines to correlate mealybug numbers with economic damage at harvest. Finally, mealybug life stages and natural enemies were recorded throughout the study. Timed 5-min counts show the strongest correlation with total mealybug numbers, and a simple count of mealybugs on three spurs per vine at midseason is the best predictor of economic damage. Mealybugs completed approximately equals 2.5 generations in 1998. Comparison to data on mealybug development suggests that exceptionally long growing seasons could exacerbate infestations by allowing the completion of a third generation. No mealybugs were found on bunches before early August, when second-generation crawlers moved out of the bark. Grape bunches that touched old wood had significantly higher damage and mealybug densities. The majority of mealybugs were always found in protected locations (under the bark of the trunk, spurs or canes), indicating the need for chemical or biological controls that can penetrate these refugia.",0
,Towards the other mythology--the offspring of darkness: Jocasta's daughters and granddaughters.,"It all started with the doubt (perhaps exaggerated) that the Gods do not know how to talk. The author presents the situation and tendencies in contemporary mythological research. The article starts out from the mythos-logos antithesis and from the twofold conception of the myth as both a fabricated and a sacred story. The allopersonages as characters of different names, who function as markers for the identical element in the structure, are contrasted by the author with the isopersonages bearing names of the same characters, who simultaneously function as markers for diverse elements or semantic strata in the structure. The term sociogony is introduced in analogy to the terms theogony and cosmogony. On the basis of a review of Croatian and mainstream mythological trends, the author perceives two main orientations in mythological research: the historical reconstruction of the Proto-Slavic myth, and research into the myth, mythic consciousness and mythic language in contemporary everyday life. The author supports the idea of differentiating mythology and religion and analyses the role of the myth, and scholarship on the myth, in forming national and cultural identity. From that aspect, we can also identify the contemporary transitional scholarly myth in today's reconstructions of the unifed Proto-Slavic myth. Remythologisation is part of retraditionalisation: Proto-Slavic fellowship is the spiritual solace by which the East responds to the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.",0

The objective of our study was to explore the potential of Emblica officinalis drug on longevity, sexual behavior, and reproductive fitness of Drosophila melanogaster using adult feeding method. Increase in the lifespan, fecundity, fertility, ovarioles number, and developmental time was observed in both parents and F1 generation, but not in the F2 generation in experimental culture (control + E. officinalis). According to the Duncan's multiple range test and ANOVA, there is a significant difference between two cultures. It was also noticed that E. officinalis influence some fitness characters in Drosophila along with sexual behavior.",1
https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006x.72.3.511,Intergenerational Transmission of Depression: Test of an Interpersonal Stress Model in a Community Sample.,"An interpersonal stress model of depression transmission was tested in a community sample of nearly 800 depressed and never-depressed women and their 15-year-old children. It was hypothesized that maternal depression (and depression in the maternal grandmother) contributed to chronic interpersonal stress in the mothers, affecting quality of parenting and youths' social competence. In turn, poor social functioning and interpersonal life events caused at least in part by the youths were predicted to be the proximal predictors of current depressive symptoms and diagnoses. Structural equation modeling confirmed the predicted associations among variables and the link between youth chronic and episodic interpersonal stress and depression. Additionally, the association between maternal and child depression was entirely mediated by the predicted family and interpersonal stress effects.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-5955(87)90048-7,Acoustic distortion products in rabbit ear canal. I. Basic features and physiological vulnerability,"In contrast to evoked otoacoustic emissions, acoustic distortion products (DPs) recorded from the ear canal are present at predictable frequencies with respect to their primary tones, f1 and f2. Such specificity may provide detailed frequency-place information concerning the functional state of limited regions of the organ of Corti following experimental intervention. However, to date, it is not clear whether emitted DPs solely reflect activity at the basilar-membrane regions of primary tones or if the remote DP site makes a significant contribution to the emitted signal measured in the ear canal. We have investigated a number of the general features of acoustic-DP generation in the rabbit so that, in later experiments, the contributions of specific basilar-membrane regions involved in generating these DPs can be identified using techniques designed to manipulate their normal properties. The first report describes the outcome of systematic manipulations of a number of stimulus conditions and alterations to the physiological state of the cochlea by exposure to fatiguing sound or anoxia. Experimental findings for the 2f1-f2 DP showed that, in general, the relations of the levels and frequency of the primary tones to DP magnitude were consistent with previously published data from other mammalian species. Additional observations for other odd-order intermodulation DPs at the 3f1-2f2 and 2f2-f1 frequencies suggested that the basic attributes of the acoustic DPs were similarly affected by systematic manipulation of the basic parameters of the primary tones and the general metabolic state of the cochlea. General anesthesia, however, did not affect DP amplitude. A companion paper describes the results of a series of subsequent experiments using response-suppression, interfering-tone, and temporary threshold shift techniques which address more directly the issue of which basilar-membrane sites contribute to the generation of different acoustic DPs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.011890,Variation in Its C-Terminal Amino Acids Determines Whether Endo-β-Mannanase Is Active or Inactive in Ripening Tomato Fruits of Different Cultivars,"Abstract Endo-β-mannanase cDNAs were cloned and characterized from ripening tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv Trust) fruit, which produces an active enzyme, and from the tomato cv Walter, which produces an inactive enzyme. There is a two-nucleotide deletion in the gene from tomato cv Walter, which results in a frame shift and the deletion of four amino acids at the C terminus of the full-length protein. Other cultivars that produce either active or inactive enzyme show the same absence or presence of the two-nucleotide deletion. The endo-β-mannanase enzyme protein was purified and characterized from ripe fruit to ensure that cDNA codes for the enzyme from fruit. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that non-ripening mutants, which also fail to exhibit endo-β-mannanase activity, do so because they fail to express the protein. In a two-way genetic cross between tomato cvs Walter and Trust, all F1 progeny from both crosses produced fruit with active enzyme, suggesting that this form is dominant and homozygous in tomato cv Trust. Self-pollination of a plant from the heterozygous F1 generation yielded F2 plants that bear fruit with and without active enzyme at a ratio appropriate to Mendelian genetic segregation of alleles. Heterologous expression of the two endo-β-mannanase genes in Escherichia coliresulted in active enzyme being produced from cultures containing the tomato cv Trust gene and inactive enzyme being produced from those containing the tomato cv Walter gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to establish key elements in the C terminus of the endo-β-mannanase protein that are essential for full enzyme activity.",0
,Hospital returns to social security but retains alternative benefits plan.,"When passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 required Holy Redeemer Hospital to return to the Social Security system on Jan. 1, 1984, the hospital examined alternatives to nonprofit hospitals' mandatory participation in the program. With a consortium of hospitals, it launched an unsuccessful lobbying effort to convince Congress to accept other options: deferring the return for several years, exempting hospitals that had left the system, or ""grandfathering"" nonprofit hospitals' employees. By Oct. 31, 1983, the hospital decided to forgo efforts to amend the legislation and made preparations for returning to the system. Employees were notified that they could continue to participate in the alternate plan (a tax-deferred annuity) or leave their account inactive until withdrawal at retirement. The plan's provisions that allowed withdrawals only under extraordinary circumstances were amended to permit withdrawals at any time. In addition, the administration introduced flexible benefits--a ""cafeteria plan""--to allow participants to choose among certain taxable and nontaxable benefits that best fit each individual's life-style.",0
,Is where we are where we were going? A dialogue of two generations.,"This article provides the dialogue of a discussion between prominent family physicians from two generations. One, from the first generation of family physicians, was a founder of the specialty who provides insights into the origins of the specialty, its goals and aspirations, and possible future directions. The other, from a younger generation, has been a leader in managed care and its effects on family medicine; this physician discusses future changes in the health care systems and reflects on whether or not family practice will be able to adapt to those changes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/130.8.1963,Mass Spectrometric Determination of Genistein Tissue Distribution in Diet-Exposed Sprague-Dawley Rats,"Genistein, the principal soy isoflavone, was administered in the diet to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats as part of a multigeneration study of potential endocrine modulation. The rats were exposed to genistein in utero, through maternal milk, and as adults through postnatal d 140 via essentially isoflavone-free feed (approximately 0.5 microg/g) fortified at 5, 100 and 500 microg/g with genistein aglycone. Analytical methods based on liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and the use of deuterated genistein were developed and validated for use in measuring genistein in serum and tissues. Pharmacokinetic analysis of serum genistein showed a significant difference (P < 0.001) in the elimination half-life and area under the concentration-time curve between male [2.97 +/- 0.14 h and 22.3 +/- 1.2 micromol/(L. h), respectively] and female rats [4.26 +/- 0.29 h and 45.6 +/- 3.1 micromol/(L. h), respectively, +/- SEM]. Endocrine-responsive tissues including brain, liver, mammary, ovary, prostate, testis, thyroid and uterus showed significant dose-dependent increases in total genistein concentration. Female liver contained the highest amount of genistein (7.3 pmol/mg tissue) and male whole brain contained the least (0.04 pmol/mg). The physiologically active aglycone form was present in tissues at fractions up to 100%, and the concentration was always greater than that observed in serum in which conjugated forms predominated (95-99%). These results for measured amounts of genistein, present as aglycone and conjugates, in putative target tissues provide a link with other studies in which blood concentrations and physiologic effects of genistein are measured.",0
https://doi.org/10.2214/ajr.09.3653,Quantitative Assessment of Bronchial Wall Attenuation With Thin-Section CT: An Indicator of Airflow Limitation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between bronchial wall attenuation on thin-section CT images and airflow limitation in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.One hundred fourteen subjects (65 men, 49 women; age range, 56-74 years) enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial underwent chest CT and prebronchodilation spirometry at a single institution. At CT, mean peak wall attenuation, wall area percentage, and luminal area were measured in the third, fourth, and fifth generations of the right B(1) and B(10) segmental bronchi. Correlations with forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV(1)) expressed as percentage of predicted value were evaluated with Spearman's rank correlation test.The peak wall attenuation of each generation of segmental bronchi correlated significantly with FEV(1) as percentage of predicted value (B(1) third, r = -0.323, p = 0.0005; B(1) fourth, r = -0.406, p < 0.0001; B(1) fifth, r = -0.478, p < 0.0001; B(10) third, r = -0.268, p = 0.004; B(10) fourth, r = -0.476, p < 0.0001; B(10) fifth, r = -0.548, p < 0.0001). The correlation coefficients were higher in peripheral airway generations. Wall area percentage and luminal area had similar significant correlations. In multivariate analysis to predict FEV(1) as percentage of predicted value, the coefficient of determination of the model with the combination of percentage of low-attenuation area (< -950 HU) and peak wall attenuation of the fifth generation of the right B(10) was 0.484; the coefficient of determination with percentage of low-attenuation area and wall area percentage was 0.40.Peak attenuation of the bronchial wall measured at CT correlates significantly with expiratory airflow obstruction in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in the distal airways.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2011.04.004,ORF-selector ESPRIT: A second generation library screen for soluble protein expression employing precise open reading frame selection,"Here we present ORF-selector ESPRIT, a 9-fold enhanced version of our technology for screening incremental truncation libraries to identify soluble high yielding constructs of challenging proteins. Gene fragments are truncated at both termini to access internal domains and the resulting reading frame problem is addressed by an unbiased, intein-based open reading frame selection yielding only in-frame DNA inserts. This enriched library is then subcloned into a standard high-level expression plasmid where tens of thousands of constructs can be assayed in a two-step process using colony- and liquid-handling robots to isolate rare highly expressing clones useful for production of multi milligram quantities of purifiable proteins. The p85α protein was used to benchmark the system resulting in isolation of all known domains, either alone or in tandem. The human kinase IKK1 was then screened resulting in purification of a predicted internal domain. This strategy provides an integrated, facile route to produce soluble proteins from challenging and poorly understood target genes at quantities compatible with structural biology, screening applications and immunisation studies. The high genetic diversity that can be sampled opens the way to study more diverse systems including multisubunit complexes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.175.4029.1477,Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (Indiana Serotype): Transovarial Transmission by Phlebotomine Sandflies,"Transovarial transmission of vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana serotype) by experimentally infected Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lutzomyia ylephiletrix to their progeny was demonstrated. Virus was recovered from all developmental stages; mean virus titers from egg to first generation adult showed a four-log increase, indicating that virus multiplication occurred during development of the sandflies. Virus titers in first generation adult females were comparable to those found in their parents. These infected female sandflies transmitted vesicular stomatitus virus Indiana by bite to susceptible animals and transmitted the virus transovarially to their offspring (second generation). Results demonstrate a possible mechanism for transmission and maintenance of this virus in nature without a vertebrate (heat) host reservoir.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.26304.x,Abnormal Phonologic Processing in Familial Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Due to a New LGI1 Mutation,"Autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTLE) is a rare familial epilepsy with onset in adolescence or early adulthood, associated with mutations of LGI1 in most families. We describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and molecular genetic study of a new ADLTLE Italian family.A four-generation family from Sardinia was studied. Clinical, neuropsychological, and genetic analysis were performed in eight living affected family members.Nine family members had seizures over four generations; four of them had auditory auras and aphasia followed by secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCs). One individual in addition had visual symptoms, and one family member had only vertigo followed by SGTCs. The side of seizure onset could not be determined in these five patients with focal seizures. The proband had febrile and afebrile tonic-clonic seizures. Two family members had only febrile seizures. Inheritance was autosomal dominant with 59% penetrance. Genetic molecular analysis showed a new LGI1 missense mutation causing a Leu154Pro substitution in six affected and one unaffected individuals. Dichotic listening performance was abnormal in four affected individuals compared with controls. Fluency and lexical abilities also were pathological in three patients. These findings showed that in patients, the left temporal lobe was less specialized in the auditory processing function than in controls.In this ADLTLE family, both seizure semiology and neuropsychological findings point to a lateral temporal lobe dysfunction. The newly identified LGI1 mutation might underlie both the seizure disorder and the neuropsychological deficits.",0
https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.218.265,"Anthropometric Differences in Preschool Children of Japanese Ancestry in Lima, Peru","Ethnic differences in the pattern and trend of growth and weight have been described in studies of migrant populations. Our objective was to compare anthropometric parameters and overweight prevalence in third and fourth generation Japanese descendant preschoolers within the Peruvian preschool population. A total of 337 measurements of height and weight from 284 children, three to five years of age, were taken over three years in one Japanese-Peruvian preschool center in Lima, Peru. The data of each parameter were classified into three ethnic groups according to their parents' surnames: Japanese descendant children (n = 104), with both parents with Japanese surnames; Japanese-Peruvian descendant (n = 93), one parent with a Japanese surname and one with a non-Japanese surname; and Peruvian descendant (n = 140), both parents with non-Japanese surnames. We used the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2000 growth charts as reference values to obtain centiles, Z scores, and body mass index (BMI). In boys, the three groups differed significantly in height, weight, BMI, Z scores, and overweight prevalence. Peruvian descendant boys were taller and heavier than Japanese-Peruvian and Japanese descendants. Moreover, Japanese-Peruvian descendant boys were taller and heavier than Japanese descendant boys. In girls, there were no significant differences in height and weight and in overweight prevalence among the three ethnic groups. Japanese descendants in Peru have height, weight and BMI values similar to those of Japanese children in Japan but lesser than Peruvian children. These findings may be related to differences in ethnic background.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/dme.1996.13.s6.63,Proinsulin Levels Predict the Development of Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) in Japanese-American Men,"Disproportionate hyperproinsulinaemia is a manifestation of the beta-cell dysfunction observed in NIDDM. However, it is unclear when this abnormality develops and whether it predicts the development of the disease. To examine whether changes in proinsulin levels predict the development of NIDDM, baseline measurements of proinsulin and immunoreactive insulin levels were made in 87 second-generation Japanese-American men, a population at high risk for the subsequent development of NIDDM. Subjects were categorized at baseline using WHO criteria as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 49) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 38). After a 5-year follow-up period, subjects were recategorized as having NGT, IGT or NIDDM using the same criteria. During follow-up, 16 subjects developed NIDDM while 71 were NGT or IGT. At baseline, individuals who subsequently developed NIDDM were more obese as measured by intra-abdominal fat area on computed tomography (p = 0.046), had higher fasting glucose (p = 0.0042), 2-h glucose (p = 0.0002), fasting C-peptide (p = 0.0011), fasting proinsulin levels (p = 0.0033), and had disproportionate hyperproinsulinaemia (p = 0.056) when compared to those who remained NGT or IGT after 5 years of follow-up. These findings suggest that alterations in proinsulin levels may also predict the subsequent development of NIDDM.",0
https://doi.org/10.3109/08880019009033398,Imipenem-Antibiotic Monotherapy in Juvenile Cancer Patients with Neutropenia,"From 1984 to 1987 two consecutive groups of juvenile cancer patients (n = 45) with fever and neutropenia corresponding in all criteria were examined. In half of the total of 90 febrile episodes and septicemias, a conventional antibiotic combination therapy (Pseudomonas-active penicillin/cephalosporin of the third generation/aminoglycoside) was instituted. In the remaining half imipenem was used as an antibiotic monoagent. In 66% and 60% of the febrile episodes treated with antibiotic combination therapy and with imipenem, respectively, septicemia was confirmed by positive blood cultures. Nineteen febrile episodes occurred in the myeloaplastic phase after bone marrow transplantation. In a comparative study of imipenem as monotherapy versus an antibiotic combination therapy the results obtained with imipenem were superior in many regards. No resistance developed necessitating change of antibiotic therapy. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, primarily responsible for catheter-associated septicemia, were susceptible. Duration of fever and thus duration of treatment were shorter. The incidence of side effects and costs were lower. Therefore, imipenem as an antibiotic monotherapy in febrile cancer patients with neutropenia appears to be more efficacious than the conventional combination therapy, even during myeloaplasia following bone marrow transplantation. The results and rationale of this retrospective analysis are discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/jsa.0b013e31818cdc98,Cartilage Repair,"The goal of all cartilage replacement techniques is the reformation of mature organized hyaline cartilage. However, currently cartilage repair techniques lead principally to production of fibrocartilage, which has material properties that are inferior to hyaline cartilage. Cell-based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte implantation hold promise for cartilage regeneration; however, these techniques still do not predictably result in hyaline cartilage formation. The newest, ""third-generation techniques"" have been developed to address the limitations of earlier techniques. These new procedures use 3 novel approaches: chondro-inductive or chondro-conductive matrix; use of allogeneic cells, both of which may allow a single-stage surgical approach; and techniques to mechanically condition the developing tissue before surgical application to improve the material properties and maturation of the implant. However, at this time there is very limited clinical data available on the nature and outcomes of these procedures.",0

We report a case of successful engraftment and stable full-donor chimerism in a patient with HLH who underwent peripheral allogeneic CD34-selected HSCT. The donor was his 1-antigen-HLA-mismatched grandmother. After a conditioning regimen based on the combination of thiotepa, fludarabine, melphalan, and rabbit antilymphocyte serum, the patient received a megadose of 26.3 x 10(6)/kg of CD34(+) peripheral blood cells. Neutrophil (>0.5 x 10(9)/L) and platelet (>50 x 10(9)/L) engraftment was observed on days +16 and +12, respectively, and the patient was discharged home on day +24. No acute or chronic GVHD was observed. Infectious complications were the main causes of re-hospitalization in the first year after transplantation, but no significant morbidity was observed thereafter. Thirty-two months after HSCT, the patient is alive and well, still in complete clinical remission of his underlying disease with a durable engraftment, normal NK activity and full donor chimerism. This case suggests that a fludarabine-based conditioning regimen and CD34-selected peripheral allogeneic HSCT may be a feasible option in case of unavailability of a fully HLA-matched related or unrelated donor.",0
https://doi.org/10.32604/biocell.2005.29.279,Seed weight variation of wyoming sagebrush in Northern Nevada,"Seed size is a crucial plant trait that may potentially affect not only immediate seedling success but also the subsequent generation. We examined variation in seed weight of Wyoming sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young), an excellent candidate species for rangeland restoration. The working hypothesis was that a major fraction of spatial and temporal variability in seed size (weight) of Wyoming sagebrush could be explained by variations in mean monthly temperatures and precipitation. Seed collection was conducted at Battle Mountain and Eden Valley sites in northern Nevada, USA, during November of 2002 and 2003. Frequency distributions of seed weight varied from leptokurtic to platykurtic, and from symmetry to skewness to the right for both sites and years. Mean seed weight varied by a factor of 1.4 between locations and years. Mean seed weight was greater (P < 0.05) in 2003 than in 2002 at both sites. This can partially be attributed to 55% greater precipitation in 2003 than 2002, since mean monthly temperatures were similar (P > 0.05) in all study situations. Simple linear regression showed that monthly precipitation (March to November) explained 85% of the total variation in mean seed weight (P = 0.079). Since the relationship between mean monthly temperature (June-November) and mean seed weight was not significant (r2 = 0.00, P = 0.431), this emphasizes the importance of precipitation as an important determinant of mean seed weight. Our results suggest that the precipitation regime to which the mother plant is exposed can have a significant effect on sizes of seeds produced. Hence, seasonal changes in water availability would tend to alter size distributions of produced offspring.",0
https://doi.org/10.2217/17460913.1.4.365,Voriconazole: a broad spectrum triazole for the treatment of serious and invasive fungal infections,"For many years, serious systemic fungal infections have been treated with amphotericin B or narrow-spectrum azole antifungals. These treatments have been effective in many patients, but are associated with tolerability or pharmacokinetic concerns, or suboptimal antifungal activity in some patient groups. Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole with an extended spectrum of activity offering the potential to treat life-threatening fungal infections. The drug is available for intravenous or oral administration and has been shown to be effective in invasive aspergillosis, fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant candidiasis, and infections caused by various other fungal pathogens, including some formerly refractory organisms. Voriconazole is generally well tolerated with transient visual disturbances, liver enzyme abnormalities and skin rashes being the most common adverse events reported, but these rarely lead to treatment discontinuation.",0
https://doi.org/10.2147/ijwh.s5865,Emergency contraception: potential role of ulipristal acetate,"Unintended pregnancy is a global reproductive health problem. Emergency contraception (EC) provides women with a safe means of preventing unwanted pregnancies after having unprotected intercourse. While 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel (LNG) as a single dose or in 2 doses with 12 hours apart is the currently gold standard EC regimen, a single dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate (UPA) has recently been proposed for EC use up to 120 hours of unprotected intercourse with similar side effect profiles as LNG. The main mechanism of action of both LNG and UPA for EC is delaying or inhibiting ovulation. However, the 'window of effect' for LNG EC seems to be rather narrow, beginning after selection of the dominant follicular and ending when luteinizing hormone peak begins to rise, whereas UPA appears to have a direct inhibitory effect on follicular rupture which allows it to be also effective even when administered shortly before ovulation, a time period when use of LNG is no longer effective. These experimental findings are in line with results from a series of clinical trials conducted recently which demonstrate that UPA seems to have higher EC efficacy compared to LNG. This review summarizes some of the data available on UPA used after unprotected intercourse with the purpose to provide evidence that UPA, a new type of second-generation progesterone receptor modulator, represents a new evolutionary step in EC treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.102015399,Elevated mutation rates in the germ line of first- and second-generation offspring of irradiated male mice,"Mutation rates at two expanded simple tandem repeat loci were studied in the germ line of first- and second-generation offspring of inbred male CBA/H, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice exposed to either high linear energy transfer fission neutrons or low linear energy transfer x-rays. Paternal CBA/H exposure to either x-rays or fission neutrons resulted in increased mutation rates in the germ line of two subsequent generations. Comparable transgenerational effects were observed also in neutron-irradiated C57BL/6 and x-irradiated BALB/c mice. The levels of spontaneous mutation rates and radiation-induced transgenerational instability varied between strains (BALB/c>CBA/H>C57BL/6). Pre- and postmeiotic paternal exposure resulted in similar increases in mutation rate in the germ line of both generations of CBA/H mice, which together with our previous results suggests that radiation-induced expanded simple tandem repeat instability is manifested in diploid cells after fertilization. The remarkable finding that radiation-induced germ-line instability persists for at least two generations raises important issues of risk evaluation in humans.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0091-6749(97)70233-1,Generation of anaphylatoxins through proteolytic processing of C3 and C5 by house dust mite protease,"The group 3 allergen of Dermatophagoides species (Der p 3 and Der f 3) has been identified as a 30 kd trypsin-like protease of the house dust mite. We previously showed that the 30 kd protease from Dermatophagoides farinae (Df-protease) could activate the bradykinin-generating cascade and exacerbate inflammatory reactions.The purpose of this study was to determine whether Df-protease could enzymatically generate anaphylatoxins from complement components C3 and C5.Df-protease was incubated with human serum C3 or C5 in a purified system, and the anaphylatoxin activity produced was assayed by measuring enhancement of vascular permeability and release of histamine from mast cells triggered by C3a and by assessing chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells caused by C5a. We also attempted to determine whether protease isolated from house dust could cause release of C5a from C5.Df-protease showed strong activation of C3 and C5, producing C3a and C5a by proteolytic cleavage of the complements. An appreciable amount of Df-protease was recovered in the house dust extract, and the house dust protease caused C5a release from C5.Df-protease activated the complement system to produce anaphylatoxins. Thus it is suggested that house dust mite proteases may contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic and inflammatory diseases caused by house dust allergens.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2003.08.014,Immunological markers contributing to successful aging in Bulgarians,"In order to clarify immunogenetic markers contributing to successful aging, HLA and cytokine gene profiles were analyzed in healthy elderly Bulgarians. Family segregation analysis was performed to define combined effect of haplotypes and immunophenotype profiles. The results of this study did not reveal any statistically significant allele and haplotype frequency differences between elderly and control group. In families with two generations longevity members we did not observed HLA alleles and haplotypes associated with autoimmunity. IL-10 genotype -1082G/A, -819 C/C, -592 C/C, related to the intermediate production, was positively associated, while genotype -1082A/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A, related to the low level of production, was negatively associated with longevity in Bulgarians. This effect was modulated by IL-6 and IFNgamma genotypes associated with the low level of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. Immunophenotypic studies indicated lower relative and absolute numbers of CD3+8+, CD8+28+ and CD8+57+ cells in elderly people. Analysis in families showed that although most pronounced in the elderly group, lower numbers of CD8+ T cells were also found in middle aged and young members of the families compared to the age matched controls. A progressive CD8+28+ cell subsets decline was seen with aging. In addition, we did not observed the 'immune risk phenotype' which is a marker of an increased inflammatory activity. Based on the results of this study, it seems reasonable to suggest that a combination of specific immunogenetic and immunophenotype profiles could contribute to the successful aging and to maintaining healthy status in elderly.",0
https://doi.org/10.1086/666657,Transgenerational Variation in Metabolism and Life-History Traits Induced by Maternal Hypoxia in<i>Daphnia magna</i>,"Hypoxic stress can alter conspecific phenotype and additionally alter phenotypes of the filial generation, for example, via maternal or epigenetic processes. Lasting effects can also be seen across development and generations even after stressors have been removed. This study utilized the model of rapidly developing, parthenogenetic Daphnia to examine the intraspecific variability of response of exposure of a parental generation to hypoxia (4 kPa) within a single clone line across development, across broods, and across generations. Body mass across development and reproductive output were monitored in the parental generation and the first three broods of the first filial generation (which were not directly exposed to hypoxia). O(2) consumption across a wide Po(2) range (normoxia to anoxia) was assessed to determine whether exposure of the parental generation to hypoxia conferred hypoxia tolerance on the offspring and whether this transgenerational, epigenetic phenomenon varied intraspecifically. Differences in mass occurred in both the parental generation (hypoxia-exposed smaller during brood 1 and brood 2 neonate production) and the filial generation (e.g., brood 1 and 2 neonates from hypoxic mothers were initially smaller than control neonates). However, differences in mass were not accompanied by changes in reproductive output (assessed by brood number and neonate size). At day 0, first filial generation brood 1 neonates from hypoxia-exposed mothers had a higher metabolic rate than control neonates. However, this effect, like that of body mass, dissipated with development within a brood but also with subsequent broods. An isometric scaling exponent for [Formula: see text] was repeatedly observed across a wide Po(2) range (21-2 kPa) throughout neonatal development.",1
,Family and socialization in cross-cultural perspective: a model of change.,"I have attempted to cover some aspects of the rather disjointed interdisciplinary field of family and socialization from a cross-cultural perspective. The coverage has necessarily been incomplete and selective, focusing mainly on intergenerational family interactions along the dependence/independence dimension, working toward a model of family change. I started out with an observation that psychology has not concerned itself much with holistic study of the family or the complex socialization process, especially within a cross-cultural perspective, even though some of the main models of person-environment relations at its disposal are appropriate for such study. With the recently increasing acceptance and use of the ecological and contextual models in coverging interdisciplinary approaches, the time may be ripe for cross-cultural theorizing on the family and socialization. The contextual approach to socially defined meaning is a key in such an endeavor to develop a thorough understanding of family diversity. Such an approach goes beyond simple description of cross-cultural differences and explains what meanings are attributed to events and how similar behaviors may be given different meanings in different contexts or how apparently contrasting behaviors may carry common meanings and lead to common outcomes. Family diversity in parental beliefs and values, parent-child interactions, and social class and family types can be better understood with such a contextual approach, where structural-functional links between underlying causes and behavioral outcomes are sought. Macro-level explanations such as industrialization, economic development models, and political/religious ideologies are often proposed to explain human diversity. What seem to be lacking are psychological models with cross-cultural validity that can tackle both human diversity and commonality. The (inter)dependence/independence dimension of human (family) relations is proposed as a psychological parameter that is independent of socioeconomic development levels and such and that has the potential to be the basis of a psychological explanation. There appears to be systematic cross-cultural variation along this dimension, and a number of assumptions prevail about shifts on this dimension through both time and space. The main assumption of unidirectional change toward the Western ideal-typical model of human (family) independence is challenged by much conflicting evidence including that on the American family. Some of the findings of the cross-cultural Value of Children Study also throw light on this issue, so that material and emotional interdependencies can be differentiated. I next proposed a heuristic model of family change comprising three ideal-typical patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2004.11.002,Old versus new: weighing the evidence between the first- and second-generation antipsychotics,"In our opinion the best guide to prescribing antipsychotics is the clinician's experience with his patients and in particular the patient being treated. If treatment works, stick with it. We feel it is also important for the clinician to consider the evidence from well-controlled double-blind random-assignment studies because in ""evidence-based medicine,"" biases both known and unknown are controlled by blinding and randomization. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and discuss the evidence on efficacy. Choice of antipsychotic, in our opinion, is probably the most important decision that the clinician makes for the psychotic patient. This involves the choice of drug, its dose, balancing efficacy, side-effects and cost.",0

Targeting the proteasome activity is a rational and novel strategy for cancer therapy that can lead to cell death for transformed cells. Today, bortezomib, a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, has established clinical efficacy and an approved clinical indication for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Since bortezomib has also shown to induce chemosensitization, the drug is utilized for combination with a variety of chemotherapeutics.

https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/50.4.707,Trends in Computer Hardware and Software,"Previously identified and current trends in the development of computer systems and in the use of computers for health care applications are reviewed. Trends identified in a 1982 article were increasing miniaturization and archival ability, increasing software costs, increasing software independence, user empowerment through new software technologies, shorter computer-system life cycles, and more rapid development and support of pharmaceutical services. Most of these trends continue today. Current trends in hardware and software include the increasing use of reduced instruction-set computing, migration to the UNIX operating system, the development of large software libraries, microprocessor-based smart terminals that allow remote validation of data, speech synthesis and recognition, application generators, fourth-generation languages, computer-aided software engineering, object-oriented technologies, and artificial intelligence. Current trends specific to pharmacy and hospitals are the withdrawal of vendors of hospital information systems from the pharmacy market, improved linkage of information systems within hospitals, and increased regulation by government. The computer industry and its products continue to undergo dynamic change. Software development continues to lag behind hardware, and its high cost is offsetting the savings provided by hardware.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/ja806655f,Cationic Terminal Gallylene Complexes by Halide Abstraction: Coordination Chemistry of a Valence Isoelectronic Analogue of CO and N<sub>2</sub>,"While N(2) and CO have played central roles in developing models of electronic structure, and their interactions with transition metals have been widely investigated, the valence isoelectronic diatomic molecules EX (E = group 13 element, X = group 17 element) have yet to be isolated under ambient conditions, either as the ""free"" molecule or as a ligand in a simple metal complex. As part of a program designed to address this deficiency, together with wider issues of the chemistry of cationic systems [L(n)M(ER)](+) (E = B, Al, Ga; R = aryl, amido, halide), we have targeted complexes of the type [L(n)M(GaX)](+). Halide abstraction is shown to be a viable method for the generation of mononuclear cationic complexes containing gallium donor ligands. The ability to isolate tractable two-coordinate products, however, is strongly dependent on the steric and electronic properties of the metal/ligand fragment. In the case of complexes containing ancillary pi-acceptor ligands such as CO, cationic complexes can only be isolated as base-trapped adducts, even with bulky aryl substituents at gallium. Base-free gallylene species such as [Cp*Fe(CO)(2)(GaMes)](+) can be identified only in the vapor phase by electrospray mass spectrometry experiments. With bis(phosphine) donor sets at the metal, the more favorable steric/electronic environment allows for the isolation of two-coordinate ligand systems, even with halide substituents at gallium. Thus, [Cp*Fe(dppe)(GaI)](+)[BAr(f)(4)](-) (9) can be synthesized and shown crystallographically to feature a terminally bound GaI ligand; 9 represents the first experimental realization of a complex containing a valence isoelectronic group 13/group 17 analogue of CO and N(2). DFT calculations reveal a relatively weakly bound GaI ligand, which is confirmed experimentally by the reaction of 9 with CO to give [Cp*Fe(dppe)(CO)](+)[BAr(f)(4)](-). In the absence of such reagents, 9 is stable for weeks in fluorobenzene solution, presumably reflecting (i) effective steric shielding of the gallium center by the ancillary phosphine and Cp* ligands; (ii) a net cationic charge which retards the tendency toward dimerization found for putative charge neutral systems; and (iii) (albeit relatively minor) population of the LUMOs of the GaI molecule through pi overlap with the HOMO and HOMO-2 of the [Cp*Fe(dppe)](+) fragment.",0

A case-control study was performed in Argentina to estimate the risk factors for CMM.The study group comprised 101 hospital cases with histologically verified melanoma and 246 controls, frequency matched by age, sex, and hospital. Individuals were interviewed about demographic and constitutional factors and sun exposure history.The following risk factors were significant in the logistic analysis: nevi on arms (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3 for 20 or more), skin phototype (OR = 4.1 for type l or ll), holidays spent at the beach (OR = 4 for more than 6 weeks lifelong), fair skin tone (OR = 3.4), light eye color (OR = 2.8), sunburn before the age of 15 years (OR = 2.4), and participation in outdoor sports (OR = 3.2 for more than 5790 h accumulated in a lifetime). Occupational sun exposure was not related to CMM risk. Educational level, hair color, and the presence of freckles were not independent risk factors for CMM.The risk factors found for the studied population, with nearly 90% of the individuals born in Argentina and with nearly 50% with four southern European grandparents, were consistent with those described for other countries. This investigation has resulted in findings that may be of use in preparing actions to prevent CMM in Argentina; these should be directed at those individuals who present the above mentioned risk factors. These actions should include instructions to avoid excessive sun exposure, with the aim to reduce melanoma incidence.",0
,[Anaphylactic reaction to oxaliplatin--a case of colon cancer].,"Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a new third-generation platinum which is efficacious in treating advanced unresectable recurrent colorectal cancer as a first-line regimen. The marketing authorization was given in Japan in March, 2005. Its increased use has resulted in rare serious adverse effects, including anaphylactic shock. We experienced a case that developed anaphylactic shock by L-OHP. We report a 69-year-old man who was treated for recurrent colorectal cancer who underwent systemic chemotherapy with FOLFOX 4. After eight cycles he developed severe L-OHP associated neuropathy and lung metastases was a progressive tendency. The FOLFOX 4 regimen was discontinued and another modality, FOLFIRI regimen, was used. After eight cycles of FOLFIRI regimen, lung and liver metastases showed progressive disease for response assessment by RECIST criteria. Although a patient was stopped L-OHP for neurotoxicity, neuropathy was disappeared after 4 months interval. Therefore, we reintroduced L-OHP, FOLFOX 4 regimen. Anaphylactic shock occurred in the second cycle of reintroduction of the FOLFOX 4 regimen (total 10 cycles), 30 minutes after infusion of L-OHP. L-OHP infusion was immediately withdrawn and he was treated with intravenous hydroxyzine hydrochloride and methylprednisolone. The anaphylaxis symptoms resolved in 30 minutes. Chemotherapy based on L-OHP for unresectable recurrence colorectal cancer causes anaphylactic shock as a rare severe complication. The prediction factor is not proved. We should take steps for early detection of anaphylactic reaction and perform the appropriate treatment.",0
,[A case report of pulmonary arterio-venous fistula complicated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis].,A 5-year-old girl with multiple pulmonary arterio-venous fistulae was reported. Both her mother and grandmother have been diagnosed as the same disease previously. Her grandmother was treated with resection of the right basal segment for arterio-venous fistulae. Her mother is well with fistulae for more than 20 years. The patient was operated upon to enucleate two larger fistulae in segments 3 and 6 of right lung. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged from the hospital on the 22nd postoperative day. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae are thought to be a part of the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasis. Enucleation of the larger fistulae of the lung are preferable even for multiple lesions.,0
https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.113.3.e270,Comparison of Linear Growth Patterns in the First Three Years of Life Across Two Generations in Guatemala,"The secular increase in height is assumed to result from long-term improvements in nutritional intakes and reductions in infectious disease burdens. Nutritional supplementation in early life reduces stunting in chronically undernourished populations. It is not known whether these improvements have an impact on the growth of subsequent generations. Our objective was to estimate the intergenerational effect on offspring length of improved nutrition in the mother's early childhood.We studied 283 mother-child pairs (mothers born 1969-1977; children born 1996-1999). The mothers had received nutritional supplementation--either atole (enhanced protein-energy) or fresco (moderate energy, no protein), with both containing vitamins and minerals--prenatally and up to age 7 y as part of a community trial conducted in 4 villages in Guatemala. Length was measured on repeated occasions to 36 months of age in both mothers and children. Growth was modeled as a fractional polynomial.Children grew faster than their mothers. Children of mothers who received atole grew faster than children of women who received fresco. In both groups, lengths of individual children were positively correlated with lengths of their own mothers at the same ages. Correlations were generally stronger when the mothers had received atole in early life.We have confirmed a secular trend in growth of children in a developing country setting. The rate of child growth reflects, in part, the growth pattern of the mother, including improvements to that pattern resulting from nutritional supplementation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2008.11.019,Neurological abnormalities among offspring of persons with schizophrenia: Relation to premorbid psychopathology,"Neurological Examination Abnormalities (NEA, often called ""neurological soft signs"") have been observed in early schizophrenia and may be heritable. We investigated the prevalence, and neurocognitive and psychopathological correlates of NEA among offspring of schizophrenia patients who are at increased genetic risk for this illness.Neurological examinations were conducted on high risk (HR, n=74) and healthy comparison subjects (HS, n=86), using the Heinrichs-Buchanan scale. Cognitive-perceptual (CogPer) and repetitive motor (RepMot) subscores, and total NEA scores were computed. All HR and HS were assessed using K-SADS/SCID for diagnoses. Schizotypy was measured using the Magical Ideation and the Perceptual Aberration subscales (Chapman scale), attention using Continuous Performance Test (CPT-IP) and executive functions using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).CogPer (F(1,160)=7.14, p=0.008) but not RepMot NEA scores were higher in HR subjects compared to HS after controlling for age and sex. CogPer NEA scores were higher in HR subjects with axis I psychopathology compared to those without (F(2,170)-6.41, p=0.002). HR subjects had higher schizotypy scores (composite of the magical ideation and perceptual aberration scales) (F(1,141)=23.25, p=0.000004). Schizotypy scores were negatively correlated with sustained attention and executive functions. In addition, schizotypy was positively correlated with CogPer NEA scores.Young relatives at increased genetic risk for schizophrenia show more frequent NEA. CogPer but not RepMot NEA scores were elevated, consistent with our prior observation of CogPer NEA being relatively specific for schizophrenia. The observed relationships between NEA, cognitive impairments, schizotypy and axis I disorders suggest that NEA may characterize a subgroup of HR offspring at an elevated risk for psychopathology.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.20824,Low birth weight of contemporary African Americans: An intergenerational effect of slavery?,"The average birth weight in the contemporary African-American population is about 250 g lower than the average birth weight of European Americans. Differences in genetic and socioeconomic factors present between these two groups can explain only part of birth weight variation. I propose a hypothesis that the low birth weight of contemporary African Americans not only results from the difference in present exposure to lifestyle factors known to affect fetal development but also from conditions experienced during the period of slavery. Slaves had poor nutritional status during all stages of life because of the inadequate dietary intake accompanied by high energetic costs of physical work and infectious diseases. The concept of “fetal programming” suggests that physiology and metabolism including growth and fat accumulation of the developing fetus, and, thus its birth weight, depend on intergenerational signal of environmental quality passed through generations of matrilinear ancestors. I suggest that several generations that have passed since the abolition of slavery in the United States (1865) has not been enough to obliterate the impact of slavery on the current biological and health condition of the African-American population.

https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.93101378,Developmental effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in wildlife and humans.,"Large numbers and large quantities of endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been released into the environment since World War II. Many of these chemicals can disturb development of the endocrine system and of the organs that respond to endocrine signals in organisms indirectly exposed during prenatal and/or early postnatal life; effects of exposure during development are permanent and irreversible. The risk to the developing organism can also stem from direct exposure of the offspring after birth or hatching. In addition, transgenerational exposure can result from the exposure of the mother to a chemical at any time throughout her life before producing offspring due to persistence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in body fat, which is mobilized during egg laying or pregnancy and lactation. Mechanisms underlying the disruption of the development of vital systems, such as the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems, are discussed with reference to wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.10.021,A review of genetic mutation in familial Hirschsprung's disease in South Africa: towards genetic counseling,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) represents a complex disorder of signaling molecules, resulting from the effects of at least 9 known susceptibility genes. Affected families carry 200 times higher risk, but genetic counseling via pedigree analysis is difficult and the significance of genetic variations is unclear. This study evaluated a set of patients affected by HSCR with familial recurrence to evaluate factors of greatest value in genetic counseling.One hundred twenty patients with HSCR (including 18 kindreds) were screened for genetic variations of the 2 major susceptibility genes (RET and endothelin B receptor [EDNRB]) and compared with 60 control samples (20 per ethnic group). Familial recurrence patterns were studied for patient sex, pattern of recurrence, presence of associated syndromic features, and genetic features of major susceptibility genes. Polymerase chain reaction and HEX-SSCP analysis were performed on DBA extracted from blood/microdissected tissue samples. SSCP variants were validated and automated sequencing techniques performed on polymerase chain reaction products showing conformational variants in acrylamide gel.Familial cases had a male-female ratio of 1.5:1, male-to-male transmission (n = 10; 2 father to son), female-to-male transmissions (n = 4; 3 female carriers, female-to-female (n = 4; 2 mother to daughter), and 1 paternal RET deletion-female with very long segment aganglionosis. Increasing gene penetrance occurred in 3 pedigrees. An increased incidence of long segment HSCR was noted in families with recurrence and appeared important. No consistent mendelian trends or specific genetic sites were observed, but 3 suggested autosomal dominant and recessive in a further 3. Identified genetic variations included deletions, frame shifts, and missense mutations, as well as a number of significant single nucleotide polymorphism variations. Transmitted RET mutations occurred in 5 (30%) of 16 kindreds. Splice RET mutation plus variants of exon 17 (973L) affected 2 children with identical total colonic aganglionosis. In a 3-generation family, variations in RET exons 6, 13, and 18 (928) affected 3 male children with increasing penetration to recur as total intestinal aganglionosis in a grandchild.Mendelian transmission appears mediated by the RET proto-oncogene. EDNRB mutations suggest haplotypic gene-gene interaction. Genetic counseling remains a challenge in HSCR because of its multfactorial etiology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.228.143,Panax Ginseng: A Newly Identified Cause of Gynecomastia,"Gynecomastia or benign proliferation of the male breast glandular tissue is not uncommon for adolescent males. Its pathogenesis has been attributed to a transient imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Ginseng is a popular herb with a long history of medicinal use. Oriental folk medicine describes it as both a tonic for restoring strength and a panacea. The term ""ginseng"" generally refers to a plant, Panax ginseng. Based on estrogen-like actions of Panax ginseng due to its structural similarity with estradiol, this agent could be speculated to cause gynecomastia. Here we report a 12-year-old Korean-Japanese boy with bilateral enlargement of the breasts with tenderness in the right breast, which was noticed about 1 month before his first visit to our outpatient clinic. He was diagnosed with gynecomastia based on physical, laboratory, and ultrasound examinations. Detailed questioning about his medications and supplements revealed that he had been given red ginseng extract daily to enhance his performance for 1 month before his clinical presentation. He wanted to make his body stronger as an athlete. He was recommended from his grandmother to take Panax ginseng for his purpose. After stopping this, there was no further growth of the masses and no pain when his right breast was pressed. In conclusion, physicians should consider ginseng in the investigation of gynecomastia.",0

Literature shows constancy in suicide statistics in Slovenia during these times.The present study examines whether the suicidal adolescent inpatient population in Slovenia reflects recent social changes and upheavals.Data on two groups of patients admitted to a specialized adolescent psychiatry department after attempting suicide were collected. The first group (n = 74) were patients admitted from 1975 to 1977, the second group (n = 73) from 2002 to 2004. They were compared on general characteristics, family and living circumstances, risk behaviors, suicide attempts and diagnoses.The comparison revealed statistically significant differences between groups on educational level, number of siblings, frequency of smoking and psychoactive medication misuse as well as number of previous suicide attempts. No differences were found in other family and living circumstances, methods used in the index suicide attempt, other risk behaviors or diagnoses.The post-independence suicidal inpatient population in Slovenia shows a tendency towards higher morbidity, but has changed less than expected considering the vast changes in the society. These results suggest a certain constancy in adolescent suicidal behavior.",0
,[Epidemiology and clinical evaluation of Salmonella enteritis].,"There was a local epidemic of Salmonella enteritis in southern part of Taiwan during the summer of 1989. From July through September 1989, a total 162 cases of enteritis were analysed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung. Among them, 46 cases were proved to be Salmonella enteritis by stool and/or blood culture. The identified flora group mainly group B (Salmonella typhimurium, 87%), group C (Salmonella choleraesuis, 6.5%) and group D (Salmonella enteritidis, 6.5%). The drug resistance of Salmonella enteritis of traditional antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in apparently increasing. We found that 43.5% of cases were uniformly resistant to all 3 antimicrobial agents as mentioned above. Of the 4 infants who developed bacteremia, 2 were less than 3 months old and their blood culture grew out group B. Salmonella, but fortunately no complication were found during hospitalization. The other 2 cases were proved to be caused by group C Salmonella which was reported to have higher incidence of ensuing bacteremia. This study revealed that persistent bacteremia could be present in the absence of fever and toxic signs. Newer, third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime of ceftriaxone should be initiated promptly.",0

This study investigated the relationship between antibiotic usage and ESBL organisms from 1994 through 2002 using epidemiological and molecular analysis.A case-control study of 119 patients with ESBL organisms and 132 patients with non-ESBL organisms was conducted. Demographics, co-morbidities, device utilization and antibiotic use were analysed for all patients and infected patients only (cases = 75, controls = 83). Both exposure and degree of exposure (in grams) to antibiotics were included. A dot blot hybridization technique was used to identify genes in plasmid extracts from the ESBL organisms.Ventilator days OR 1.1 (1.06, 1.15) P < 0.001, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) OR 3.1 (1.0, 9.7) P = 0.05, prior aminoglycoside use OR 2.7 (1.2, 6.1) P = 0.02, prior third-generation cephalosporin use OR 7.2 (2.6, 20) P < 0.001, and prior trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole use OR 8.8 (3.1, 26) P < 0.001 were significantly associated with ESBL organisms by multivariate analysis. All models were concordant with a significant association of ventilator days, third-generation cephalosporins and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with ESBL organisms. beta-Lactamase inhibitor combinations were not associated with ESBL organisms. Hybridization of plasmid extracts demonstrated that 95% of the ESBL organisms carried intI1, a mobile DNA element with a sulphonamide-resistance (R) gene and a frequent carrier of other R factors. Genes for specific types of trimethoprim-R and aminoglycoside-R were present in 26% and 40% of the extracts, respectively.These data indicate that, besides patient risk factors and third-generation cephalosporins, other antibiotics may provide selective pressures in maintaining ESBL organisms due to multiple resistance genes on plasmids. beta-Lactamase inhibitor combinations appear to be an acceptable substitute to third-generation cephalosporins in strategies to control ESBL organisms.",0

https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.108.089433,Transmission Dynamics of Heritable Silencing Induced by Double-Stranded RNA in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>,"Abstract Heritable silencing effects are gene suppression phenomena that can persist for generations after induction. In the majority of RNAi experiments conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans, the silencing response results in a hypomorphic phenotype where the effects recede after the F1 generation. F2 and subsequent generations revert to the original phenotype. Specific examples of transgenerational RNAi in which effects persist to the F2 generation and beyond have been described. In this study, we describe a systematic pedigree-based analysis of heritable silencing processes resulting from initiation of interference targeted at the C. elegans oocyte maturation factor oma-1. Heritable silencing of oma-1 is a dose-dependent process where the inheritance of the silencing factor is unequally distributed among the population. Heritability is not constant over generational time, with silenced populations appearing to undergo a bottleneck three to four generations following microinjection of RNA. Transmission of silencing through these generations can be through either maternal or paternal gamete lines and is surprisingly more effective through the male gametic line. Genetic linkage tests reveal that silencing in the early generations is transmitted independently of the original targeted locus, in a manner indicative of a diffusible epigenetic element.",1

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been recently identified as the leading cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in HD. A variable prevalence of hepatitis in HD has appeared in the literature, ranging between 1% and 29% in the Western world, and between 30% and 54% in Saudi Arabia, but all these reports used first-generation ELISA. Using second-generation enzyme immunoassay, we conducted a multi-centre study involving 22 HD centres all over Saudi Arabia in order to establish the prevalence and risk factors for HCV in HD patients in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1147 patients were studied, with a mean age of 43.4 +/- 15.3 years. Five hundred and eighty were males and 567 were females. The overall prevalence rate of positive anti-HCV was 68%, with a range from as low as 14.5%, to 94.7%. To our knowledge, this is the highest value reported among dialysis patients world-wide. A positive correlation was found between anti-HCV positivity and male sex (P = 0.005), longer duration on dialysis (P = 0.002) and blood transfusion (P = 0.003). However, interestingly 62.6% of the patients who had not had blood transfusion had anti-HCV antibodies. HCV antibodies were also found more frequently in Egyptians, Pakistanis and Yemenis than in Saudis.

IPV has public health implications that affect current victims and may impact future generations. While all people are at risk for IPV, women are 5 times more likely to be victimized. Despite all of the literature regarding IPV, there is still a compliance issue regarding screening for IPV in health care settings. Utilizing the Synergy Model of Nursing Practice, this article demonstrates the care of victims of IPV by the clinical nurse specialist. The Synergy Model framework is described, and correlated with IPV The clinical nurse specialist plays a unique role that can improve patient outcomes through many domains including expert clinical practice, role modeling, education, global systems thinking, research, consultation, and holistic approaches to care. Current state of the science practice techniques and barriers to screening are discussed. The summary highlights suggestions for future research.",0

https://doi.org/10.2298/mpns0802079z,Lynch syndrome I: A case report,"Introduction. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndromes J and II, accounts for about 5-8% of colorectal cancers. Lynch syndrome I is an autosomal domi?nant inherited disorder characterized by early onset of colorectal cancer, predominance of proximal and multiple tumors, and microsatellite instability. In order to identify HNPCC, the international ""Amsterdam criteria"" have been used. Case report. The proband was a 40-year-old male who was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of advanced rectal cancer. Left colectomy was carried out. A histopathologic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of clinical stage Dukes C was made. The family talking was done and it was revealed that the pro-band had five family members (one of first degree relative) with colorectal cancer, and two successive generations affected. All malignancy were diagnosed before 45 years of age. In one family member, metachronous transverse cancer was revealed 12 years after surgery for cecal adenocarcinoma. Discussion and conclusion. The main molecular cause for HNPCC is constitutional mutation in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes that regulate the excision of errors occurring during DNA replication. The most often are mutations of MLHI and MSH2 genes, and microsatellite instability is present in about 90-95% HNPCC. In this report, we present a case of an HNPCC patient who met the Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome I. Family members that fulfill the Amsterdam criteria should be investigated for mutation in MMR genes. The genetic tests are not routinely available, so colonoscopic screening of all asymptomatic family members older than 25 has been recommended.",0

A total of 35 patients (20 men, 15 women) with stones located in the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney were randomized prospectively to undergo lithotripsy with a third generation lithotriptor (Stone Lith, smart PCK) after receiving either EA (n=17) or TM (n=18) for sedation and analgesia. EA treatment was applied to patients by the same licensed acupuncturist 30 min prior to ESWL in group EA. Tramadol (1.5 mg/kg) 30 min before the start of lithotripsy and midazolam (0.06 mg/kg) 5 min prior to ESWL were given as a sedo-analgesic intravenously to group TM. During ESWL, blood pressure, heart rate, pain and sedation levels were measured at baseline and every 15 min thereafter. The pain intensity perceived during lithotripsy was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). There was no statistical differences in the diameters of the stones and age of the patients between groups (P=0.590; P=0.568, respectively). In the EA group, the median of maximum energy level achieved was 16.0 kV (range 10–23 kV), while it was 18.0 kV (range 10–20 kV) in the TM group. There was no statistically significant difference between the maximum energy levels applied to the patients during ESWL (P=0.613). The median numbers of shockwaves were 2,114 (range 1,100–3,800) and 2,200 (range 1,500–3,200) in the EA and TM groups, respectively. In the TM group, the numbers of shockwaves used were higher than in group EA during ESWL. However, this difference was not significant (P=0.732). VAS scores were consistently lower in the EA group compared with the TM group throughout the ESWL procedure. The median VAS score was 5.0 (range 1–10) in the EA group while it was 8.0 (range 2–10) in the TM group. The patients who underwent EA had lower median scores of VAS than patients who took only conservative treatment, but this difference was not significant (P=0.245). When both groups were compared for stone-free rates, no significant difference was found [82.3% (14/17) for group EA, 88.8% (16/18) for group TM] (P=0.658). Durations of ESWL procedures were similar in both groups [median 27.4 min (range 15.7–34.3) in group EA vs 27.1 min (range 16.1–33.6) in group TM] (P=0.517). No side effects was seen in any patient who received EA. Side effects such as mild orthostatic hypotension and dizziness occurred in patients given sedo-analgesia, but these were not severe enough to require any patient to be excluded from the study. Our study shows that EA is an effective method for inducing sedation with analgesia without any demonstrable side effects.",0

The relationship between values and self-esteem was also investigated. Sixty inter-generational triads (30M;30F) rated 14 values on a semantic-differential scale. The hypotheses of generational similarities in long-term, central (in Rokeach's terms, terminal) values and of generational differences in short term, specific (Rokeach's instrumental) values were generally supported. However, the hypothesized interactions of self-esteem and generation with values were only minimally supported by these data. There were no generational differences in the terminal values Equality, An Exciting Life, Freedom, and A Sense of Accomplishment. The oldest generation rated the instrumental values Ambition, Capability, Independence, and Intelligence higher than did the other generations. In addition, they rated the more work-oriented values of Education, Money, Success and Work highest. These findings are discussed as possible cohort rather than as age effects. Women rated Ambition, Education, and Intelligence more highly than men.",1
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.19.10746,Emergence of homeostasis and “noise imprinting” in an evolution model,"Homeostasis, the creation of a stabilized internal milieu, is ubiquitous in biological evolution, despite the entropic cost of excluding noise information from a region. The advantages of stability seem self evident, but the alternatives are not so clear. This issue was studied by means of numerical experiments on a simple evolution model: a population of Boolean network ""organisms"" selected for performance of a curve-fitting task while subjected to noise. During evolution, noise sensitivity increased with fitness. Noise exclusion evolved spontaneously, but only if the noise was sufficiently unpredictable. Noise that was limited to one or a few stereotyped patterns caused symmetry breaking that prevented noise exclusion. Instead, the organisms incorporated the noise into their function at little cost in ultimate fitness and became totally noise dependent. This ""noise imprinting"" suggests caution when interpreting apparent adaptations seen in nature. If the noise was totally random from generation to generation, noise exclusion evolved reliably and irreversibly, but if the noise was correlated over several generations, maladaptive selection of noise-dependent traits could reverse noise exclusion, with catastrophic effect on population fitness. Noise entering the selection process rather than the organism had a different effect: adaptive evolution was totally abolished above a critical noise amplitude, in a manner resembling a thermodynamic phase transition. Evolutionary adaptation to noise involves the creation of a subsystem screened from noise information but increasingly vulnerable to its effects. Similar considerations may apply to information channeling in human cultural evolution.",0

In order to achieve this goal, DNA polymerases (Pols) have to faithfully execute DNA synthesis during chromosome replication and repair. However, the conditions under which Pols synthesize DNA are not always optimal; the template DNA can be damaged by various endogenous and exogenous genotoxic agents including reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS oxidize dNTPs in the nucleotide pool from which Pols elongate DNA strands. Both damaged DNA and oxidized dNTPs interfere with faithful DNA synthesis by Pols, inducing various cellular abnormalities, such as mutations, cancer, neurological diseases, and cellular senescence. In this review, we focus on the process by which Pols incorporate oxidized dNTPs into DNA and compare the properties of Pols: efficiency, i.e., k cat / K m , k pol / K d or V max / K m , and template base preference for the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, an oxidized form of dGTP. In general, Pols involved in chromosome replication, the A- and B-family Pols, are resistant to the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, whereas Pols involved in repair and/or translesion synthesis, the X- and Y-family Pols, incorporate nucleotides in a relatively efficient manner and tend to incorporate it opposite template dA rather than template dC, though there are several exceptions. We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which Pols exhibit different template base preferences for the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP and how Pols are involved in the induction of mutations via the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides under oxidative stress.",0
,The evolving role of endocrine therapy for breast cancer,"The indirect comparison of LHRH agonist with tamoxifen showed similar efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. Furthermore, LHRH agonist is as effective as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Data concerning combination of LHRH agonist with third-generation aromatase inhibitors are still lacking. Moreover, duration of therapy with LHRH agonist is still a matter of debate. In randomized clinical trials, each of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) has demonstrated efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with receptor' -positive tumors. Anastrozole has been shown to improve disease-free survival when compared with tamoxifen, letrozole has been shown to further reduce the rate of breast cancer events when given as extended adjuvant therapy in women completing between 4.5 and 6 years of tamoxifen, and exemestane has been shown to improve disease-free survival when substituted for tamoxifen after an initial 2-3 years of adjuvant therapy. Although long-term follow-up for safety and overall survival continues in each of these trials, currently available data suggest that an AI should now be included as part of adjuvant endocrine therapy for the great majority of receptor-positive postmenopausal patients.",0

Two X-irradiated male fish were pair-mated with non-irradiated females to produce F1 founders, and each F1 fish was pair-mated with a non-irradiated fish to produce F2 progeny. For detection of recessive mutations, pair-matings between F2 siblings were performed for each F1 family. Morphogenesis of the embryos of each generation was observed using a stereomicroscope, throughout the entire period of embryonic development. In the F1 embryos, the frequencies of dominant lethals and malformations were increased by the X-irradiation. Two out of 30 F1 pairs produced a number of malformed and lethal F2 embryos, indicating inheritance of high rates of the dominant lethals in the two F1 families. Moreover, F2 sib-pairs offspring of which exibited high rates of dominant lethals were found in 10 out of 28 F1 families. Recessive lethal mutations, which were associated with a particular phenotype, were found in 2 out of the 28 F1 families. These results indicate that the heritable malformations induced by X-irradiation can be studied in the medaka.",1

,The place of IVF in infertility care.,"In vitro fertilization has become standard treatment for infertility without the benefit of thorough evaluation. Today, the effectiveness of IVF is the subject of ongoing debate, the medical and non-medical risks of treatment are not adequately understood, and there is great concern about the true costs of care both for individuals and society. Added to this debate are ethical dilemmas which have changed the way we think about reproductive rights, the family, parenthood, intergenerational responsibilities, and the legal status of children and embryos. In order to address these issues, the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe held a meeting in June 1990 on the Place of In Vitro Fertilization in Infertility Care.

Affected broiler-breeders exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic and microscopic lesions associated with inclusion body hepatitis (IBH). The isolated adenovirus, identified as Stanford, was molecularly characterized as European serotype 9. The pathogenicity of the Stanford strain was confirmed after inoculation of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 1-7 days of age, causing 100% and 20% mortality, respectively. The level of protection against IBH was evaluated in two broiler-breeder progenies from AAV 8/11-vaccinated grandparent flocks and a commercial broiler flock by challenge at 1 or 7 days of age with the AAV 8 and 11 serotypes and/or the Stanford strain. The broiler-breeder progenies and the commercial broiler flock exhibited protection against IBH after challenge. No significant differences in mean body weights were observed at 3 wk of age in any of the evaluated groups. We conclude that broiler-breeder progenies from 30- to 50-wk-old grandparents vaccinated with the AAV 8/11 vaccine were adequately protected against challenge with the AAV 8 and 11 serotypes and the Stanford strain.",0

The mean age at arthroplasty was 39 years (range, 14-50 years), and follow up averaged 9 years (range, 5-13 years). There were 13 revisions (7 related to polyethylene wear and/or osteolysis, 5 for instability, and 1 for infection). No femoral components were revised for loosening and none were radiographically loose. Two acetabular shells were revised for loosening secondary to extensive osteolysis.

This hyper-instability of Pc-1 is useful for detecting germline mutation using a small number of experimental animals, although its molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We examined the effect of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mutation on the spontaneous germline mutation at the Pc-1 locus using the CB17 mouse strain. Our results showed that the frequency of spontaneous germline mutation at Pc-1 in the offspring of wild-type parents was 9.7%. In F1 between SCID male and wild-type female, however, the frequency of germline mutation was drastically increased to 42.3%. When SCID female mice were mated with wild-type male, the frequency of germline mutation in F1 was slightly increased to 13.6%. These results suggest that DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), deficiency of which causes SCID mutation, plays an important role in the stable transmission of a genome containing hypervariable tandem repeats to progeny in male germ cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.1997.15.7.2589,Treatment of ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver by hepatic arterial chemotherapy.,"PURPOSE Ocular melanoma is characterized by a high rate of liver metastases and is associated with a median survival time less than 5 months. There is no standard treatment available. Treatment strategies have, without success, relied on the experience with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. The only effective treatment is chemoembolization using cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge, which has never become accepted on a large scale. The objective of the study was to establish prospectively the efficacy and toxicity of hepatic intraarterial fotemustine, a third-generation nitrosourea, in patients with liver metastases from ocular melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-one patients were subjected to laparotomy to place a totally implantable catheter into the hepatic artery and received fotemustine 100 mg/m2 as a 4-hour infusion, first once a week for four times and then, after a 5-week rest period, every 3 weeks until progression or toxicity. Cox regression models were used to assess the prognostic role of patient survival characteristics. RESULTS Objective responses were observed in 12 of 30 assessable patients (40%; 95% confidence interval, 22% to 59%). The median duration of response was 11 months and the median overall survival time, 14 months. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) appeared to be the strongest prognostic factor for survival. Toxicity was minimal and treatment could be administered on an outpatient basis. CONCLUSION The results of hepatic arterial chemotherapy with fotemustine produced a high response rate and survival similar to chemoembolization therapy. It involves no major toxicity and preserves the quality of life. To assess further its effectiveness, a randomized study to compare hepatic intraarterial versus intravenous chemotherapy is being planned.",0

Offspring were raised until sexual maturity at 2 months of age. Mice from prenatally irradiated mothers and unexposed fathers, or from prenatally irradiated fathers and unexposed mothers, or from parents who had both been prenatally irradiated were mated, resulting in the birth of several mice. These second generation mice were tested as adults for hearing thresholds, with the ABR technique, subjectively to balance tests. and investigated morphologically. Hearing levels were found to be normal and the organ of Corti showed only minor changes of its inner and outer hair cells as shown by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that prenatal irradiation does not seem to cause mutations leading to impaired hearing and balance in second generation mice.",1
https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620200512,"An evaluation of the etiology of reduced CYP1A1 messenger RNA expression in the Atlantic tomcod from the Hudson River, New York, USA, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis","Adult Atlantic tomcod, Microgadus tomcod, from the Hudson River, New York State, USA, exhibit reduced inducibility of hepatic cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) mRNA compared with adult tomcod from the cleaner Miramichi River, New Brunswick, Canada, when treated with coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. In contrast, little difference in CYP1A1 inducibility is observed between tomcod from these two rivers when treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We sought to determine if impaired hepatic CYP1A1 inducibility in Hudson River tomcod results from a multigenerational, genetic adaptation or a single generational, physiological acclimation. Embryos and larvae from controlled experimental crosses of Hudson River and Miramichi River parents were exposed for 24 h to water-borne PCB congener 77 (10 ppm), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP; 10 ppm), or dimethysulfoxide, and CYP1A1 expression was assessed in individual larva using competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The CYP1A1 mRNA was significantly induced in larvae from both populations by BaP (47- and 52-fold) and PCB 77 (9- and 22-fold), although levels of expression were higher in offspring of Miramichi matings. Most important, CYP1A1 mRNA was significantly induced by PCB 77 in larvae from Hudson River parents. Concentrations of dioxin, furan, and PCB congeners were measured in livers and eggs of female tomcod from these two locales to quantify the extent of maternal transfer of contaminants. For both rivers, wet-weight contaminant concentrations were significantly higher (4-7 times) in livers than in eggs of the same females, suggesting that a threshold level of contaminants may have to be reached before CYP1A1 transcription is impaired. We conclude that reduced inducibility of hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA in adult tomcod from the Hudson River is most consistent with single-generational acclimation.",0
https://doi.org/10.1353/hub.2002.0036,The Peopling of Sao Tome (Gulf of Guinea): Origins of Slave Settlers and Admixture with the Portuguese,"The geographic origins of African slave settlers and the Portuguese genetic contribution to the population of São Tomé (Gulf of Guinea) were assessed through the analysis of beta-globin haplotypes in 44 chromosomes bearing the betaS allele and through the study of the genetic variation in eight autosomal markers (APOA1, AT3, FY, LPL, OCA2, RB1, Sb19.3, and GC) informative for admixture in a sample of 224 individuals. The observed betaS haplotype distribution (36.4% Bantu, 52.3% Benin, 4.5% Cameroon, 4.5% Senegal, and 2.3% atypical) is in accordance with the historical information on the major geographic sources of slave settlers of São Tomé, although it captures a more important contribution of Central-West Africa regions than previously anticipated. European admixture, estimated to be 10.7 +/- 0.9%, has created a considerable level of genetic structure, as indicated by the finding of significant linkage disequilibrium between 33% of unlinked marker loci pairs. Recent admixture was found to have an important contribution to these values, since removal of individuals with Portuguese or Cape Verdian parents or grandparents from the sample dropped the miscegenation level to 6.5 +/- 0.8% and reduced significant linkage disequilibrium to 11% of unlinked marker pairs. Taken together, these results indicate that the peopling of São Tomé might have provided one of the first examples of the combination of diverse African contributions and European admixture that emerged from the overseas population relocations promoted by the Atlantic slave trade.",0

Seizures are similar to those of reading epilepsy (RE). The nosologic position of language-induced epilepsy is not clear. We performed a clinical and neurophysiological study in a multigenerational family with the association of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) with ictal stuttering as a manifestation of reflex language-induced epilepsy.Nine members on three generations were studied. All patients underwent video-polygraphic EEG recordings (awake and during sleep). A standardized protocol was applied to test the effect of language and non-language-related tasks.Six patients presented language-induced jaw jerking that mimicked stuttering and corresponded to focal myoclonus involving facial muscles. This was associated with an IGE phenotype in four of these patients. Focal EEG spikes were found in all six patients by visual analysis and/or back-averaging techniques. The focal spikes were either asymptomatic (when followed by a slow wave) or symptomatic of facial myoclonia (when isolated). Levetiracetam, used as add-on or monotherapy in four patients, suppressed ictal stuttering. One additional case only had a phenotype of IGE without focal features.This family study demonstrates the phenotypic heterogeneity of the association of IGE phenotype with ictal stuttering (language-related reflex seizure). Our data suggest that this particular form of reflex epilepsy related to language has more similarities with generalized epilepsies than with focal ones. Neurophysiological investigations should be performed more systematically in patients with acquired stuttering, especially if there is family history of IGE.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/jamp.2011.0911,Regulatory Aspects of Phase 3 Endpoints for New Inhaled Antibiotics for Cystic Fibrosis Patients with Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections,"Available regulatory guidelines for developing inhaled anti-infective therapies offer general advice, but specific guidance often provides conflicting and outdated advice in regard to clinical trial design. For instance, the availability of two approved drugs makes the conduct of placebo-controlled trials longer than 28 days problematic. Comparator drugs require use per the product label, making comparator trials difficult to blind as taste, foaming, regimen, device, and delivery time differences are present. Currently, there is no consensus on the most appropriate endpoints for evaluation of aerosolized antimicrobials. FEV(1) is a surrogate endpoint that it is a predictor of mortality--it is standardized, reproducible, noninvasive, simple, and inexpensive to perform but small statistically significant changes may not be clinically important. FEV(1) improvement also has a ceiling effect in patients with mild lung function impairment and spirometry cannot be reliably done in patients under the age of 6 years. A patient-reported outcome is a promising clinical endpoint. However, there is not currently an accepted tool that can be used as a primary endpoint for the FDA or the EMA, although the latter recognizes the CFQ-R as a validated secondary endpoint and the FDA grandfathered acceptance of the CFQ-R respiratory domain in the pivotal aztreonam for inhalation study. Exacerbations are an important clinical endpoint that reflects morbidity and are a major driver of cost of care, but they occur infrequently and a standardized definition has not been reached. Furthermore, an exacerbation endpoint may fail even with an otherwise effective antibiotic therapy. Regulatory authorities will have a difficult time approving any new inhaled antibiotic based on one clinical endpoint alone.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2010.038042,Can antibiotic use be both just and sustainable... or only more or less so?,"Antibiotic resistance threatens the capacity to treat life-threatening infections. If it is accepted that it will be many years (if not decades) until the production of new antibiotics overcomes current concerns with antibiotic resistance then ways to conserve the effectiveness of current antibiotics will have to be found. For many bacterial agents of infection levels of antibiotic resistance are directly dependent on the quantity of antibiotic prescribed. Antibiotics are currently underutilised in many parts of the world. If a just distribution of access to antibiotics requires equal access for individuals with equal need irrespective of wealth then responding to this requirement of justice has the potential to shorten the effective life of currently available antibiotics. Increasing the range and numbers of individuals treated with antibiotics would seem to threaten sustainability and also potentially undermine the access of future generations to cost-effective treatments for bacterial infection. The control of antibiotic resistance requires that the determinants of infectious disease transmission are addressed, such as poor housing, education and nutrition as well as the provision of antibiotics. The apparent tension between intragenerational justice and sustainability diminishes when the account of distributive justice extends beyond access to antibiotics and includes plural entitlements. Controlling antibiotic resistance requires more than the redistribution or reduction (in the overall use) of antibiotics.",0

An extensively coated stem was introduced in 1992 to reduce that risk. We therefore asked whether second-generation extensively porous-coated cementless femoral stems in patients younger than 50 years of age would (1) be durable in terms of revisions; (2) provide high functional scores and reduce thigh pain; and (3) show radiographic signs of durability, including a reduction in stress shielding. We prospectively followed all 100 patients (115 hips) age 50 and younger treated with primary cementless total hip arthroplasties using a second-generation extensively porous-coated femoral stem between June 1994 and December 1999. The average age was 39.6 years (range, 17-50 years). The stems were mated to cementless acetabular components. Ninety patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years (mean, 8.6 years; range, 5-10 years). One stem was revised after a periprosthetic fracture. None were revised for loosening and all stems demonstrated bony ingrowth at last followup. No acetabular shell was revised for loosening and none was radiographically loose.

No differences were found in basal levels of the coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters between smokers and non-smokers. During oral contraceptive administration, both F1+2 fragment and thrombin-antithrombin III complex concentrations significantly increased both in smokers and in non-smokers (p < 0.01). Fibrinogen plasma levels increased in both groups (p < 0.01). Antithrombin III activity was reduced in both groups during treatment, but the difference was significant only in smokers (p < 0.05). Although the sample size of smokers was too small to draw definitive conclusions, present results appeared to confirm previous data about the effect of the concurrent use of smoking and oral contraceptives on antithrombin III levels, but did not demonstrate any additional effect of moderate smoking on the activation of the clotting system induced by this oral contraceptive preparation.",0

Between January 1988 and July 1992, we used this system in staging an additional 1814 patients, on whom 2980 intranasal sphenoethmoidectomies were performed. In this staging system a protocol trial of medication was given for 2 weeks, followed by axial and coronal computed tomography. Medication consisted of a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, usually cefuroxime; a 4-day burst of intraoral steroids, usually prednisone; and an antihistamine decongestant if not contraindicated. The stages of chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis included the stages described in the 1990 report (i.e., stage I, single-focus disease; stage II, discontiguous disease throughout the ethmoid labyrinth; stage III, diffuse disease responsive to medication; and stage IV, diffuse disease unresponsive to or poorly responsive to medication). The results of this study have shown that the computed tomography staging system based on computed tomography extent of disease after medical therapy is a simple, easily remembered, and very effective modality for the classification of chronic sinusitis. This system provides a rationale for discussing and planning surgery with patients and physicians and is a convenient reference for the reporting of end results. More importantly, a linear relationship between disease stage and outcomes is demonstrated. This statistically highly significant feature of the staging system provides a firm basis for the production of outcomes after various treatment strategies, particularly ethmoidectomy and the treatment of sinusitis.",0

Nitrocefin was used to detect beta-lactamase (betaLac) production isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. Serotype b was assessed by slide co-agglutination.From 245 H. influenzae identified, 155 were tested for serotype b, 28% (43/155) of which were positive. The global rate of beta-lactamase-positive isolates was 9% (22/245). Resistance was similar among serotype b (11.6%) and non-type b H. influenzae (9.8%) (p>0.05). No difference on betaLac production was found according to specimen's origin or the patients' age. Resistances to other antibiotics (by agar dilution and disc diffusion method, respectively) were: chloramphenicol 3.3 to 7.1%; cefaclor: 1.6 to 3.9% and cotrimoxazol: 9.1 to 10.5%. No resistance to cefotaxime has been detected; 63% (5/8) beta-Lac-positive isolates by agar dilution showed also resistance to chloramphenicol, compared to 3% (4/118) in the ss-Lac-negative group (p<0.001).H. influenzae ampicillin-resistance has shown to be lower than other hospital-based-studies in São Paulo, and comparable to rates found in healthy carriers. The association between ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance was significant: where this pattern is frequently found, the initial therapy for severe H. influenzae infections - like meningitis - should include a third generation cephalosporin.",0
https://doi.org/10.2174/187152506775268758,"Imidazoline Receptors, Novel Agents and Therapeutic Potential","The initial realization that agents containing an imidazoline structure may interact with a distinct class of receptors, has led to a major class of cardiovascular agents, which now has the potential to enter a third generation. There is now general acceptance that there are three main imidazoline receptor classes, the I(1) imidazoline receptor which mediates the sympatho-inhibitory actions to lower blood pressure, the I(2) receptor which is an important allosteric binding site of monoamine oxidase and the I(3) receptor which regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Thus all three represent important targets for cardiovascular research. Interestingly, an I(1)- receptor candidate has been cloned (IRAS, imidazoline receptor antisera selected) which is a homologue of the mouse cell adhesion integrin binding protein Nischarin. There has been range of new agonists and antagonists with very high selectivity for I(1), I(2) and I(3) receptors developed. Three different endogenous ligands have been characterized including agmatine (decarboxylated arginine), a range of beta-carbolines including harman and harmane, and more recently imidazoleacetic acid-ribotide. The imidazoline field has recently seen an enormous diversification with discoveries that I(1) and I(2) receptors also play a role in cell proliferation, regulation of body fat, neuroprotection, inflammation and some psychiatric disorders such as depression. This diversification has continued with the addition of effective agents with imidazoline affinity in the fields of cancer, pain and opioid addiction, stress, cell adhesion, epilepsy and appetite. The imidazoline field has maturated considerably with a range of highly selective leader molecules, candidate receptors and endogenous ligands. We are therefore only at the threshold of an exciting new era as we begin to understand the diverse and complex nature of their function.",0
https://doi.org/10.1542/pir.19-4-118,Cephalosporins: An Update,"The cephalosporins are the largest and most diverse family of antimicrobial agents available. Although they rarely are considered drugs of first choice for the therapy of bacterial infections, they are the most commonly prescribed agents for both ambulatory and hospitalized patients. The first-generation agents have the most limited spectrum of bactericidal activity, but they are the most potent against Gram-positive microbes. The third- and fourth-generation agents have a broad spectrum of activity that includes the majority of Gram-negative pathogens. However, they are less active than their first-generation counterparts against Gram-positive bacteria, especially S aureus. The cephalosporins generally are well tolerated, and the oral agents are palatable. However, their use is limited by increasing resistance among certain groups of bacteria and high cost, especially of the parenteral and recently licensed oral agents. The prudent physician need not be familiar with all cephalosporins, but should be knowledgeable about a select few.",0

In vitro susceptibility testing of eight antimicrobial agents, including ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, against 95 clinical isolates was carried out. Detection of mutations in the gyrA and parC genes was performed by sequence analysis. The clinical isolates demonstrated 100 % resistance to ciprofloxacin and 98.9 % non-susceptibility to levofloxacin. All of the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. For cefepime, spectinomycin and tetracycline, 98.9, 94.7 and 1.1 % of the isolates were susceptible, respectively. None of the isolates was susceptible to penicillin. Five types based on gyrA mutations could be categorized among 54 isolates with seven different mutation sites found on their parC gene. Analysis of sequence results showed that the gyrA mutation Asp-95→Ala and the parC mutations Ser-87→Arg and Ser-87→Asn made a significant contribution to the resistance to fluoroquinolones, in addition to double mutations found in each gene. Therefore, the use of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections in Jiangsu Province is not recommended, while the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and spectinomycin is recommended.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-12-064188,Fatal hemorrhage in mice lacking γ-glutamyl carboxylase,"Abstract The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (γ-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the γ-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx+/− intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx−/− offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)–deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for γ-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",0

Videotaped family interaction tasks, analyzed with Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior, showed that women who had been sexually abused in their childhood families were more self-focused, rather than child-focused, compared to nonabused women. In interviews, the women who had been abused gave strong evidence of greater reliance on their children for emotional support. These findings lend support to theoretical and clinical impressions of highly permeable intergenerational boundaries, including parent-child role reversal, in family systems marked by child sexual abuse, even when the abuse occurred in the previous generation.",0

Studies with wild Rattus norvegicus have shown that a novel object in a familiar cage results in avoidance reactions (neophobia) in those animals, but it is also well established that the wild R. norvegicus show strong aversive reactivity to a variety of high intensity stimuli. In this study we aimed to create low-stress conditions enabling the comparison of spontaneous exploratory behaviour directed at a novel object in male (age=80 days) ""wild-type"" WWCPS rats (n=21; fourth generation bred in captivity) and Wistar (n=24) rats. The study involved repeated placing of individual animals in the experimental chamber for 15 (6 min) trials on consecutive days. On the 11th day the novel object was introduced. Animals were tested in darkness and without human presence. Under these conditions neither WWCPS nor Wistar have shown behavioural signs of high emotional arousal, both lines have shown comparable general levels of experimental cage exploration and the positive new object exploratory reaction was observed only in Wistar rats.",0

The cardiac output derived from the two sites was also compared to the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) derived cardiac output to reevaluate the relation between them using the newer software. The effect of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was also studied by doing the sub analysis before and after bypass. Forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in the study. Cardiac output derived from radial artery (RADCO), femoral artery (FEMCO) using FloTrac/Vigileo system with third generation software version 3.02 and cardiac output using pulmonary artery catheter (PACCO) at predefined nine time points were recorded. Three hundred and forty two cardiac output data triplets were analysed. The Bland–Altman analysis of RADCO and FEMCO revealed a mean bias of −0.28 with percentage error of 20%. The pre CPB precision of both RADCO and FEMCO was 1.25 times as that of PACCO. The post CPB precision of FEMCO was 1.2 times of PACCO while that of RADCO was 1.7 times of PACCO. The third generation of FloTrac/Vigileo system shows good correlation between the radial and femoral derived cardiac outputs in both pre and post bypass periods. The newer software correlates better to PAC derived cardiac output in the post bypass period for femoral artery than radial artery.",0
https://doi.org/10.2741/1520,A three-generation approach in biodemography is based on the developmental profiles and the epigenetics of female gametes,"We suggest that there are three premises underlying the need for biodemographic analyses of three-generations: 1.) To describe the structure of the genome, we need to use (apart from mutations) other kinds of heritable changes such as those mediated by facultative elements (variations) and epigenetic alterations. 2.) There are many reasons to analyze individual development and its deviations, such as the biodemographic perspective of fertilization - but also including all long-term intra-generational events of oogenesis and meiosis (beginning with the embryogenesis of the individual's mother - or during the grandmother's pregnancy). 3.) We need to explore the reality that every fertilized egg links - physically and genetically - three successive generations. We focus on genetic and epigenetic events, which start during egg cell lineage determination in F(n-2) gestation and which influence the developmental profile of F(n) generation cohorts. The three-generation approach in epidemiology and biodemography is important so that we might increase our understanding of the effects of environmental forces, such as viral epidemics, and of catastrophes, such as the Chernobyl accident. It is also important for evaluating the processes of senescence and the determinants of human disease.",1

Their rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential to patient management. To evaluate the prospective utility of Seeplex® DPO technology in respiratory virus diagnosis, a panel of 99 respiratory samples positive by real-time RT-PCR for one or more viruses was assayed by the Seegene Seeplex® RV12 system. As well as being able to detect all 10 viruses in the real-time RT-PCR system with the exception of enteroviruses, RV12 can also distinguish between the two subgroups of RSV and detect two subgroups of coronaviruses. Seven of the nine viruses in common with the RT-PCR were detected reliably by RV12. Eleven samples RT-PCR-positive for Metapneumovirus and five samples positive for influenza B were not detected by RV12. Seegene developed a second-generation system, RV15, which not only allowed detection of three additional viruses, but also addressed the potential problems with RV12 specificity. To address these concerns, 84 respiratory samples positive for a range of viruses by real-time PCR were assayed with RV15. The results of this evaluation improved significantly upon those seen with RV12. The high throughput capabilities and potential lower technical requirements afforded by the Seeplex® system may offer an alternative to real-time RT-PCR systems.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/pr300494e,Recent Insights into Plant–Virus Interactions through Proteomic Analysis,"Plant viruses represent a major threat for a wide range of host species causing severe losses in agricultural practices. The full comprehension of mechanisms underlying events of virus–host plant interaction is crucial to devise novel plant resistance strategies. Until now, functional genomics studies in plant–virus interaction have been limited mainly on transcriptomic analysis. Only recently are proteomic approaches starting to provide important contributions to this area of research. Classical two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) is still the most widely used platform in plant proteome analysis, although in the last years the application of quantitative “second generation” proteomic techniques (such as differential in gel electrophoresis, DIGE, and gel-free protein separation methods) are emerging as more powerful analytical approaches. Apparently simple, plant–virus interactions reveal a really complex pathophysiological context, in which resistance, defense and susceptibility, and direct virus-induced reactions interplay to trigger expression responses of hundreds of genes. Given that, this review is specifically focused on comparative proteome-based studies on pathogenesis of several viral genera, including some of the most important and widespread plant viruses of the genus Tobamovirus, Sobemovirus, Cucumovirus and Potyvirus. In all, this overview reveals a widespread repression of proteins associated with the photosynthetic apparatus, while energy metabolism/protein synthesis and turnover are typically up-regulated, indicating a major redirection of cell metabolism. Other common features include the modulation of metabolisms concerning sugars, cell wall, and reactive oxigen species as well as pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. The fine-tuning between plant development and antiviral defense mechanisms determines new patterns of regulation of common metabolic pathways. By offering a 360-degree view of protein modulation, all proteomic tools reveal the extraordinary intricacy of mechanisms with which a simple viral genome perturbs the plant cell molecular networks. This “omic” approach, while providing a global perspective and useful information to the understanding of the plant host–virus interactome, may possibly reveal protein targets/markers useful in the design of future diagnosis and/or plant protection strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1134/s1022795410070057,Genetic variation in a sorghum line with multiple genetic instability induced with ethidium bromide in an in vitro culture,"Ethidium bromide treatment (15 mg/l, 26 degrees C, 18 h) of a sorghum Zheltozernoe 10 callus culture yielded line Zh10-brl displaying multiple genetic instability. The line was characterized by a broad variety of mutations, which were identified in consecutive generations obtained from one initial regenerant via self-pollination. The mutation caused male sterility (male sterility, generation R1), a low plant height (dwarfness, R2), a reduced awn length (awnless, R3), yellow leaves in seedlings (xantha, R6), leaf variegation (leaf variegation, R6), leaf bleaching (virescence, R6), etc. In some cases, segregation in families suggested a monogenic recessive inheritance for the induced mutations. Male sterility was due to a range of defects that affected microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis and were probably caused by mutations of several genes. Leaf variegation was due to the appearance of green areas in originally albino seedling leaves; the reversion occurred only in somatic tissues without affecting male and female gametes. In male-sterile and variegated mutants, sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP) analysis with primers to the Isaak transposon revealed new DNA fragments, which were absent from the original line. The results supported the hypothesis that the mutations isolated in line Zh10-brl result from transposon mobilization induced by ethidium bromide and/or in vitro culture conditions.",0

Additional insights come from a four-decade experience of seven generations of a family of German origin with autosomal dominant (chromosome 1p1-1q1) cardiac conduction and myocardial disease.A total of 38 family members (20 males; 18 females) were identified with sudden death. Twenty-eight family members (mean age 48+/-8 years) from earlier generations had no pacemaker at the time of sudden death. In this group, 15 subjects were asymptomatic prior to sudden death. Ten family members with sudden death, from later generations, had chronically implanted pacemakers for high grade atrioventricular block. This group was older (mean age 57+/-2 years), with decreased functional status (New York Heart Association class II to IV), enlarged left atria, dilated left ventricles with reduced systolic function and documented ventricular fibrillation in three members. Twenty-eight family members with sudden death were descendants of sib lineages 2 or 6; 21 family members with sudden death were offspring of a parent who also suffered sudden death.Sudden death is an important late outcome in heritable (chromosome 1p1-1q1) cardiac conduction and myocardial disease. Pacemaker therapy is important for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, but it does not prevent sudden death. Family members who are beyond the third decade of life with reduced functional capacity, left ventricular dysfunction, pacemakers and who are the offspring of a parent with sudden death appear to be at greatest risk",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcq086,Overexpression of a Profilin (GhPFN2) Promotes the Progression of Developmental Phases in Cotton Fibers,"Cotton fiber development at the stages of elongation and secondary wall synthesis determines the traits of fiber length and strength. To date, the mechanisms controlling the progression of these two phases remain elusive. In this work, the function of a fiber-preferential actin-binding protein (GhPFN2) was characterized by cytological and molecular studies on the fibers of transgenic green-colored cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) through three successive generations. Overexpression of GhPFN2 caused pre-terminated cell elongation, resulting in a marked decrease in the length of mature fibers. Cytoskeleton staining and quantitative assay revealed that thicker and more abundant F-actin bundles formed during the elongation stage in GhPFN2-overexpressing fibers. Accompanying this alteration, the developmental reorientation of transverse microtubules to the oblique direction was advanced by 2 d at the period of transition from elongation to secondary wall deposition. Birefringence and reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed that earlier onset of secondary wall synthesis occurred in parallel. These data demonstrate that formation of the higher actin structure plays a determinant role in the progression of developmental phases in cotton fibers, and that GhPFN2 acts as a critical modulator in this process. Such a function of the actin cytoskeleton in cell phase conversion may be common to other secondary wall-containing plant cells.",0

This mutation confers resistance not only to imatinib, but also to second-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases, such as nilotinib and dasatinib. A number of strategies have been implemented to overcome this resistance, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only established therapeutic option for a cure. A 61-year-old male was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic-phase CML in 2002. He was initially treated with imatinib and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved 12 months later. However, after 18 months, a loss of CCyR was observed and a molecular study at 24 months revealed a T315I mutation of the BCR-ABL gene. At 30 months, imatinib/interferon-alfa (IFNα) combination therapy was initiated in an effort to overcome the resistance. Thirty months later, he re-achieved CCyR, and the T315I BCR-ABL mutation disappeared at 51 months. To our knowledge, this is the first case report showing the effectiveness of imatinib/IFNα combination therapy for CML patients bearing the T315I BCR-ABL mutation.",0
,In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.,"Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.",0
,Perception of the mothers concerning the received social support in home care to the premature children,"This study of qualitative approach aimed at knowing the perception of mothers of premature newborn concerning the social support received in the home care. The sample included 12 mothers of premature, older than 20 years, in the coverage area of Family Health Units of Passo Fundo-RS. The data were collected through semi-structured interview, genogram and echomap. The thematic analysis evidenced the grandmothers as builders and maintaining of the social nest; the discouragement of the abandonment; the safe base; and the social inclusion promoted by the friends. The social support not supplied is centered in the care to the newborn and in the activities of the home. This way, the mothers' perception reveals a predominant intrafamiliar support, whose expansion would allow configuring a more effective social net for the strengthness of the maternal care.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/6825,High-resolution mapping of quantitative trait loci in outbred mice,"Screening the whole genome of a cross between two inbred animal strains has proved to be a powerful method for detecting genetic loci underlying quantitative behavioural traits, but the level of resolution offered by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is still too coarse to permit molecular cloning of the genetic determinants. To achieve high-resolution mapping, we used an outbred stock of mice for which the entire genealogy is known. The heterogeneous stock (HS) was established 30 years ago from an eight-way cross of C57BL/6, BALB/c, RIII, AKR, DBA/2, I, A/J and C3H inbred mouse strains. At the time of the experiment reported here, the HS mice were at generation 58, theoretically offering at least a 30-fold increase in resolution for QTL mapping compared with a backcross or an F2 intercross. Using the HS mice we have mapped a QTL influencing a psychological trait in mice to a 0.8-cM interval on chromosome 1. This method allows simultaneous fine mapping of multiple QTLs, as shown by our report of a second QTL on chromosome 12. The high resolution possible with this approach makes QTLs accessible to positional cloning.",0

Using Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria, remarkable bactericidal action (up to a 10(9)-fold reduction in live bacteria count in the surface-exposed solution and a 100% inactivation of the surface-adhered bacteria) of an amino-glass slide covalently derivatized with N-hexyl,methyl-polyethylenimine (PEI) is found to be due to rupturing bacterial cell membranes by the polymeric chains.

Finally, the immobilized N-alkyl-PEI, while deadly to bacteria, is determined to be harmless to mammalian (monkey kidney) cells.",0
https://doi.org/10.1107/s0909049596009739,Studies of the Structure of Matter with Photons from an X-ray Free-Electron Laser,"X-ray free-electron lasers offer the potential for fourth-generation ultra-high peak power and coherence X-ray beams in the hard X-ray (8 keV) spectral range. A critical review of three areas of potential application of such sources is presented. Owing to the enormous electric field strength at the focus of such beams, it is shown that matter would very rapidly form a plasma for focal spots of submicrometer dimensions. Thus, hologram formation would only be feasible for crystalline samples with dimensions of a few micrometers or greater. A new version of X-ray holography using interference between a sample and a reference two-dimensional crystal is proposed. Because of the very high peak intensity of the free-electron-laser pulses, a natural application is to time-resolved multibunch ;dynamic X-ray scattering' measurements. It is shown that this could provide information on dynamical processes in condensed matter complementary to that obtained using slow neutron beams. Finally, optical laser-induced pump-probe-type experiments are reviewed. There is the potential for extending the study of the charge distribution of electronic excited states to those with lifetimes in the submillisecond time range.",0
https://doi.org/10.1021/ac048806v,Silver Nanowire Layer-by-Layer Films as Substrates for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering,"In this paper, the fabrication of highly stable, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active dendrimer/silver nanowire layer-by-layer (LBL) films is reported. Ag nanowires, approximately 100 nm in diameter, were produced in solution and transferred, using the LBL technique, onto a single fifth-generation DAB-Am dendrimer layer on a glass substrate. The Ag nanowires, and the resulting LBL films were characterized using UV-visible surface plasmon absorbance, while the LBL films were further characterized by atomic force microscopy measurements and surface-enhanced Raman and resonance Raman scattering of several analytes. The dendrimer was found to effectively immobilize the Ag nanowires with increased control over spacing and aggregation of the particles. These films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS/SERRS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement, and trace detection capability. Several trial analytes were tested using a variety of excitation energies, and results confirmed effective enhancement of Raman signals throughout the visible range (442-785 nm) with different molecules. Analytes were deposited onto the enhancing Ag nanowire LBL films surface using both casting and Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer transferring techniques.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.225,No evidence for niche segregation in a North American Cattail (<i>Typha</i>) species complex,"Interspecific hybridization can lead to a breakdown of species boundaries, and is of particular concern in cases in which one of the parental species is invasive. Cattails (Typha spp.) have increased their abundance in the Great Lakes region of North America over the past 150 years. This increase in the distribution of cattails is associated with hybridization between broad-leaved (Typha latifolia) and narrow-leaved cattails (T. angustifolia). The resulting hybrids occur predominantly as F(1)s, which are known as T. × glauca, although later-generation hybrids have also been documented. It has been proposed that in sympatric populations, the parental species and hybrids are often spatially segregated according to growth in contrasting water depths, and that this should promote the maintenance of parental species. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the two species and their hybrids segregate along a water-depth gradient at sites where they are sympatric. We identified the two parental species and their hybrids using molecular genetic markers (SSR), and measured shoot elevations (a proxy for water depth) at 18 sites in Southern Ontario, Canada. We found no evidence for niche segregation among species based on elevation. Our data indicate that all three lineages compete for similar habitat where they co-occur suggesting that there is potential for an overall loss of biodiversity in the species complex, particularly if the hybrid lineage is more vigorous compared to the parental species, as has been suggested by other authors.",0

https://doi.org/10.1021/jp906339u,Heterogeneous Electron Transfer of a Two-Centered Heme Protein: Redox and Electrocatalytic Properties of Surface-Immobilized Cytochrome c4,"The recombinant diheme cytochrome c(4) from the psycrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 and its Met64Ala and Met164Ala variants, which feature a hydroxide ion axially bound to the heme iron at the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, were found to exchange electrons efficiently with a gold electrode coated with a SAM of 11-mercapto-1-undecanoic acid. The mutation-induced removal of the redox equivalence of the two heme groups and changes in the net charge of the protein lobes yield two-centered protein systems with unprecedented properties in the electrode-immobilized state. The heterogeneous and intraheme electron transfer processes were characterized for these species in which the high- and low-potential heme groups are swapped over in the bilobal protein framework and experience a constrained (M64A) and unconstrained (M164A) orientation toward the electrode. The reduction thermodynamics for the native and mutated hemes were measured for the first time for a diheme cytochrome c. In the diffusing regime, they reproduce closely those for the corresponding centers in single-heme class-I cytochromes c, despite the low sequence identity. Larger differences are observed in the thermodynamics of the immobilized species and in the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants. T-dependent kinetic measurements show that the proteins are positioned approximately 7 A from the HOOC-terminated SAM-coated electrode. Protein-electrode orientation and efficient intraheme ET enable the His,OH(-)-ligated heme A of the immobilized Met64Ala variant to carry out the reductive electrocatalysis of molecular oxygen. This system therefore constitutes a novel two-centered heme-based biocatalytic interface to be exploited for ""third-generation"" amperometric biosensing.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00809.x,The Guppy as a Conservation Model: Implications of Parasitism and Inbreeding for Reintroduction Success,"Ex situ conservation is of increasing importance to prevent the extinction of endangered animals in the wild. Despite low success rates of reintroduction programs few researchers have investigated empirically the efficacy of captive breeding regimes for the release of captive-bred vertebrates. We used guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two populations in Trinidad to compare different conservation breeding regimes. The upper Aripo population was chosen for its small effective population size (N(e) approximately 100) and genetic isolation, which makes it representative of many endangered natural populations. By contrast, the lower Aripo population is a genetically diverse, much larger population (N(e) approximately 2400). We examined three captive-breeding regimes: (1) inbreeding fish crossed with their full siblings, (2) minimized inbreeding, no consanguineous matings, and (3) control fish crossed at random. We kept pedigree records for all regimes so that we could calculate inbreeding coefficients over four generations. The body size and fertility of guppies was significantly reduced due to inbreeding depression. The genetic load of sterile equivalents was particularly high for the lower Aripo population. Body size also declined due to breeding conditions in the captive environment. After four generations in captivity, the fish were released into a mesocosm in Trinidad. Captive-bred guppies were extremely susceptible to gyrodactylid parasites (58% survival rate) compared with their wild counterparts (96% survival). A reduced level of immunogenetic variation due to inbreeding and lack of exposure to natural parasites may have rendered captive-bred individuals more prone to infectious disease. The threat of disease outbreak is particularly high when naive captive-bred hosts are released in wild populations. Susceptible, captive-bred hosts could facilitate the transmission of parasites throughout the wild population, thus initiating an epidemic. This risk could potentially be reduced by prior exposure to parasites before release and gradual release of captive-bred individuals.",0
,[Retrospective study of the value of the RIBA-3 test in 68 patients with discordant serologies with regard to hepatitis C obtained with third generation ELISA tests. Is there still a value in RIBA-3?].,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability of RIBA-3 to resolve cases with controversial ELISA results, since modifications have been introduced by the manufacturer in July 1997 to analyse immunoblot patterns. Sera from 68 patients are studied: 49 controversial cases Ortho/Murex, 17 Ortho/Abbott and 2 cases tested by the three ELISA kits. Indeterminate patterns by ELISA assays remain unresolved in 65% of the samples. RIBA analysis performed in patients with controversial results Ortho/Murex seems to reveal a lack in sensitivity of the Murex kit, but does not show differences in the specificity between these two immunoassays. The RIBA patterns among the samples with Ortho/Abbott controversial results do not demonstrate any discrepancy in the sensitivity of these ELISA tests but it appears that Ortho could be less specific. Our data need to be further confirmed by the analysis of more samples. At last, when the ELISA result is included in the grayzone, the RIBA pattern is generally indeterminate and it is negative in other cases. Finally, the controversial ELISA results, that are mainly found in patients with severe immunosuppression, remain indeterminate depending on the RIBA test. Moreover, the immunoblot is less sensitive and more expensive than any other HCV ELISA test, so there is no convenience to use it for confirmation of a preliminary positive or indeterminate screening.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-291x(84)90399-1,Activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) of rat heart mitochondria by glyburide,"The effects of the second generation sulfonylurea, glyburide, on the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDC) of rat myocardial tissue were examined using rat ventricular slices and isolated mitochondria. Therapeutic concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-6)M) of glyburide produced a 30% increase in the decarboxylation of [1(-14)C] pyruvate by the PDC of ventricular tissue. Addition of glyburide to intact rat heart mitochondria stimulated activity of the PDC in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximal stimulation of the enzyme occurred with 6 X 10(-5)M glyburide and maximal activation of the enzyme was achieved with 1 X 10(-4)M glyburide. At the height of stimulation, PDC activities were 6-fold greater than those observed under control conditions with succinate alone. When mitochondria were disrupted by sonication or freeze-thawing, glyburide produced no stimulation of pyruvate decarboxylation. We conclude that glyburide directly stimulates the decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDC of the myocardium. Furthermore, the presence of intact mitochondria is necessary for the stimulatory action of glyburide on the PDC.",0

In vitro experiments showed a linear relation between the voltage setting and the pressure at F2. In vitro stone disintegration studies showed a considerable reduction in shockwave pressure variability, improved energy transfer to the stone, and a unique linear relation between fragmentation and electrode voltage without a saturation effect. This new concept has been used clinically in the Sonolith 4000 lithotripter. In 142 evaluable treatments with a 3-month follow-up, the overall stone-free rate was 82%, and the retreatment rate in stone-free patients was 10%. For stones equal or less than 10 mm, the 3-month stone-free rate, retreatment rate, and secondary procedure rate were 85%, 5%, and 0%, respectively. For stones between 11 and 20 mm, these figures were 83%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. The efficiency quotient was found to be 81% for stones equal or less than 10 mm and 78% for stones between 11 and 20 mm.

https://doi.org/10.1203/01.pdr.0000219301.19958.a0,Developmental Regulation of GTP-CH1 in the Porcine Lung and Its Relationship to Pulmonary Vascular Relaxation,"Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in lowering pulmonary vascular resistance after birth. However, in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) NO-mediated dilation is dysfunctional. GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GTP-CH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of 6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) an essential cofactor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Suboptimal levels of BH4 may result in NOS uncoupling and the subsequent generation of harmful superoxide anions. We therefore investigated the functional effects of supplementing BH4 and/or a superoxide dismutase mimetic (MnTMPyP) in porcine intrapulmonary arteries from normal animals and from a porcine model of PPHN. We investigated whether any functional effects of BH4 could be explained by changes in GTP-CH1 expression. Supplementation of BH4 significantly improved endothelium-dependent relaxations in arteries from 3- and 14-d-old healthy animals, whereas no effect was seen in vessels from younger animals and adults. GTP-CH1 protein expression was lowest at 3 and 14 d, suggesting a rate limitation of BH4 at this time. BH4 supplementation alone did not improve the relaxant response to acetylcholine in arteries obtained in a porcine model of PPHN. Furthermore, GTP-CH1 protein expression was normal for age. However, co-treatment with both BH4 and MnTMPyP restored endothelial function. GTP-CH1 is developmentally regulated in the pulmonary vasculature of neonates and this results in a functionally significant limitation of BH4. Although GTP-CH-1/BH4 levels alone do not explain the profound endothelial dysfunction seen in PPHN, increasing NO bioavailability by supplementing BH4 and quenching superoxide may prove to be therapeutically beneficial.",0
,[Efficacy analysis of third-generation plus platinum doublets in the first-line chemotherapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer].,"To compare the chemotherapeutic efficacies of third-generation plus platinum doublets in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.A total of 1112 patients were diagnosed as advanced NSCLC at Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Cancer Hospital from January 2005 to August 2009. Their clinical efficacies and regimen compositions were retrospectively analyzed. All calculations were performed by SPSS 17.0.Differences in objective response rate (ORR) existed among four third-generation agents (paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and docetaxel) plus platinum doublets. Their ORRs were 35.6%, 35.4%, 25.9% and 37.4% respectively (χ(2) = 16.331, P = 0.001). And vinorelbine doublets had the lowest ORR (all P < 0.01). The ORRs of cisplatin and carboplatin doublets were 35.2% and 33.5% respectively. There was no difference in ORR among them (χ(2) = 0.352, P = 0.569). Subgroup analysis showed that the ORRs of four third generation plus platinum doublets were 34.8%, 35.3%, 23.2% and 37.1% in non-agers. And the vinorelbine doublets performed the worst. In the patients with squamous-cell lung cancer, the ORRs of paclitaxel and gemcitabine doublets were 45.5% and 28.4% respectively. And the paclitaxel doublets had the better performance (χ(2) = 5.250, P = 0.026). When combined with carboplatin, the ORRs of four doublets were 36.2%, 16.7%, 15.4% and 32.0% respectively. And the paclitaxel regimen was more effective than the gemcitabine and vinorelbine regimens (P = 0.018 and P = 0.034). The influences of subsequent therapy were nullified when the progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. The PFSs of these doublets were (3.67 ± 0.19), (2.95 ± 0.18), (3.05 ± 0.36) and (3.40 ± 0.37) months respectively. There was no difference among them. Pairwise comparisons showed that the mean PFS of patients on paclitaxel doublets was longer than those on gemcitabine doublets. And their PFSs were (3.67 ± 0.19) and (2.95 ± 0.18) months respectively (χ(2) = 7.037, P = 0.008). The PFSs of cisplatin and carboplatin doublets were (3.05 ± 0.14) and (3.65 ± 0.20) months respectively. The patients on carboplatin doublets had a longer PFS than that of those on cisplatin doublets (χ(2) = 6.012, P = 0.014).No difference exist in ORRs among different third-generation plus platinum doublets. But as the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC, carboplatin doublets is superior to cisplatin doublets in terms of PFS.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.20327,Double-strand DNA break repair with replication slippage on two strands: a novel mechanism of deletion formation,"We have characterized an unusual family with two different androgen receptor (AR) gene deletions, in which we propose a novel mechanism of deletion formation has occurred. Affected individuals have the X-linked disorder androgen insensitivity syndrome, and we previously showed that different family members have deletions of different exons of the AR gene. We have now fully sequenced the deletions from affected individuals, and confirmed the presence of different deletions in different affected family members. Most affected and heterozygote individuals have a 4,430-bp deletion of exon 5 that occurred between repeated GTGGCAT motifs in introns 4 and 5. One affected hemizygous individual has a 4,033-bp deletion of exons 6 and 7 that occurred between repeated CCTC motifs in introns 5 and 7. The intron 5 breakpoint junctions of the two deletions are only 11 bp apart. Surprisingly, the maternal grandmother of the original index case was found to be mosaic for both deletional events, as well as having the normal AR gene. Karyotyping ruled out 47,XXX trisomy, indicating triple mosaicism for the two different deleted AR alleles and a normal AR allele. This triple mosaicism must have occurred early in embryonic development, as both deletions were passed on to different children. Based on these findings, we propose a novel mechanism of deletion formation. We suggest that during AR gene replication, a double strand DNA break occurred in intron 5, and that a variant of replication slippage occurred on both newly synthesized strands between the repeat motifs of microhomology, leading to the formation of the two different AR gene deletions.",0

These strains were shown to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), with CTX-M-1- and CTX-M-15-type beta-lactamases being responsible for this phenotype. The bla(CTX-M-1) gene was encountered most commonly and was characterised in seven E. coli strains isolated from cattle, swine and poultry, whereas bla(CTX-M-15) was identified in one E. coli isolated from cattle. These genes were located on a conjugative plasmid and were linked to the insertion sequence ISEcp1, which could have contributed to dissemination of the resistance gene. No epidemiological link between the strains was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, although two plasmids were identical in two strains isolated from swine and in two strains isolated from cattle and poultry. Thus, this study describes the emergence of ESBLs in animals in France, with a probable similar prevalence rate to that observed in humans. This is a major concern because of the possibility of transfer of these genes between animal species as well as to humans, leading to treatment failures in veterinary and human medicine.",0

With that aim, the scientific education and training of young students is an obvious and urgent necessity. We claim here that Hydra provides a highly versatile but cheap model organism to study biology at any age. Teachers of biology have the unenviable task of motivating young people, who with many other motivations that are quite valid, nevertheless must be guided along a path congruent with a 'syllabus' or a 'curriculum'. The biology of Hydra spans the history of biology as an experimental science from Trembley's first manipulations designed to determine if the green polyp he found was plant or animal to the dissection of the molecular cascades underpinning, regeneration, wound healing, stemness, aging and cancer. It is described here in terms designed to elicit its wider use in classrooms. Simple lessons are outlined in sufficient detail for beginners to enter the world of 'Hydra biology'. Protocols start with the simplest observations to experiments that have been pretested with students in the USA and in Europe. The lessons are practical and can be used to bring 'life', but also rational thinking into the study of life for the teachers of students from elementary school through early university.",0

The two generation reproduction study was designed and conducted in accordance with OECD Guideline No. 416 [OECD, 1983. Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals, Guideline No. 416. Two Generation Reproduction Toxicity Study, adopted on 26th May 1983] and in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (OECD, 1997 Principles of Good Laboratory Practice for the Testing of Chemicals. OECD, C(97)186/Final). The curcumin, mixed in the experimental diet at the concentrations of 1500, 3000 and 10,000 ppm was fed to three groups of rats, i.e., low, mid and high dose groups, and studied for two successive generations. A concurrent control group received experimental diet without the curcumin mixture. There were no treatment related adverse toxicological effects in the parental animals. No gross or microscopic changes were observed in any of the organs. None of the reproductive parameters were affected and there were no effects on the offspring other than a small reduction in pre-weaning body weight gain of the F2 pups at the highest dose level. It was concluded that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for reproductive toxicity of curcumin, fed in the diet for two successive generations to rats in this study was 10,000 ppm, which is equivalent to 847 and 959 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) per day for male rats and 1043 and 1076 for females for F0 and F1 generations, respectively. This study was the final toxicology study on curcumin reviewed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) at the 61st Meeting, 2003. The JECFA group considered that the small body weight reduction in the F2 pups of the highest dose group prevented this from being regarded as a no adverse effect level, and so allocated an ADI for curcumin of 0-3 mg/kg bw based on the intake of 250-320 mg/kg bw in the mid-dose group as the NOEL.",0
https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00179.x,The Influence of Past Endogamy and Consanguinity on Genetic Disorders in Northern Sweden,"It has been widely believed that consanguineous marriage was infrequent in northern Europe. As part of ongoing studies into the population structure of northern Sweden, the Demographic DataBase of Umeå University has undertaken digitization of the parish record books of the Swedish Lutheran Church, which date back to the late 17th century. To examine the prevalence and patterns of consanguineous marriage, information from the DataBase was abstracted for the Skellefteå region during the period 1720-1899 and extended family pedigrees constructed. Of the 14,639 marriages recorded, 3,043 (20.8%) were between couples related as sixth cousins or closer. Following changes in the Swedish civil law in 1844 that removed the requirement of royal dispensation for first cousin unions, a significant increase in first cousin marriages occurred during the next two generations, even though the total population of the region grew significantly. There was also strong evidence that consanguineous marriages were favoured within particular families. The findings of the study are consistent with the patterns of single gene disorders reported in specific communities in the region, and they suggest that founder effect, drift and consanguinity all were important influences on population genetic structure in previous generations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00428.2007,Endothelial cell barrier protection by simvastatin: GTPase regulation and NADPH oxidase inhibition,"The statins, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that lower serum cholesterol, exhibit myriad clinical benefits, including enhanced vascular integrity. One potential mechanism underlying increased endothelial cell (EC) barrier function is inhibition of geranylgeranylation, a covalent modification enabling translocation of the small GTPases Rho and Rac to the cell membrane. While RhoA inhibition attenuates actin stress fiber formation and promotes EC barrier function, Rac1 inhibition at the cell membrane potentially prevents activation of NADPH oxidase and subsequent generation of superoxides known to induce barrier disruption. We examined the relative regulatory effects of simvastatin on RhoA, Rac1, and NADPH oxidase activities in the context of human pulmonary artery EC barrier protection. Confluent EC treated with simvastatin demonstrated significantly decreased thrombin-induced FITC-dextran permeability, a reflection of vascular integrity, which was linked temporally to simvastatin-mediated actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. Compared with Rho inhibition alone (Y-27632), simvastatin afforded additional protection against thrombin-mediated barrier dysfunction and attenuated LPS-induced EC permeability and superoxide generation. Statin-mediated inhibition of both Rac translocation to the cell membrane and superoxide production were attenuated by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), indicating that these effects are due to geranylgeranylation inhibition. Finally, thrombin-induced EC permeability was modestly attenuated by reduced Rac1 expression (small interfering RNA), whereas these effects were made more pronounced by simvastatin pretreatment. Together, these data suggest EC barrier protection by simvastatin is due to dual inhibitory effects on RhoA and Rac1 as well as the attenuation of superoxide generation by EC NADPH oxidase and contribute to the molecular mechanistic understanding of the modulation of EC barrier properties by simvastatin.",0
,[Contraception and sexology].,"This work argues that contraceptive education urgently requires a new approach that will take into account the client's sexuality at the time the choice of method is made. Emotional factors such as a conscious or unconscious desire for pregnancy or motherhood, family pressures to produce a grandchild, or shame and distrust of contraception may contribute to contraceptive failure. Methods applied at the time of coitus such as condoms or spermicides may not be appropriate for clients for who contraception is a source of anxiety or guilt. The more effective, noncoital-dependent methods including oral contraceptives (OCs), IUDs, and sterilization may generate anxiety over infertility. Their efficacy may lack appeal for clients who enjoy an element of risk. The practitioner's attitude and knowledge may be further influences on the counseling over method choice. Among reversible methods, OCs are ideal for most women as long as they individually prescribed. OCs may be particularly important to the sexual expression of specific groups such as those over 35 with no risk factors other than age. Low-dose progestin-only OCs may be prescribed for this group, although about 10% of users change methods because of menstrual problems. IUDs are usually successfully used by women who have been carefully selected to exclude contraindications. In some cases the partner may be annoyed by the string, which can be rolled up and pushed out of the way or shortened by the practitioner. IUDs are often the best alternative for women with contraindications to OCs or who tolerate their side effects poorly. Spermicides may cause dermatoses or allergies that cause the woman to avoid intercourse. Some women dislike using spermicides because they must be applied prior to each use. Their bad taste is a disadvantage for some couples. Involving the male partner in application of the spermicide may remove some objections. The Billings or cervical mucus method should be avoided by women with irregular cycles and those who are reluctant to touch their genitalia. Diaphragms and cervical caps can be inserted by the male partner is desired. Menstrual extraction, insertion of an IUD within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, or use of sufficiently high dose of oral hormones prevent pregnancy in most cases, but should not be relied upon for routine contraception. Much misinformation persists about the side effects of female sterilization, which is said to cause weight gain or sexual problems or to be followed inevitably by total hysterectomy. Most women are satisfied with the operation and express no regrets. Although reversal rates are improving, sterilization should be considered definitive. Condom use remains limited despite some increases related to fear of HIV infection. Condoms may increase performance anxiety in some men. Couples should be taught to use condoms in a more sensual manner. Withdrawal is still widely used throughout the world despite lack of esthetics appeal and high failure rate.",1
https://doi.org/10.1021/es104216b,Acute and Chronic Toxicity Effects of Silver Nanoparticles (NPs) on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>,"The use of nanoscaled materials is rapidly increasing, however, their possible ecotoxicological effects are still not precisely known. This work constitutes the first complex study focused on in vivo evaluation of the acute and chronic toxic effects and toxic limits of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on the eukaryotic organism Drosophila melanogaster. For the purpose of this study, silver NPs were prepared in the form of solid dispersion using microencapsulation method, where mannitol was used as an encapsulation agent. This newly prepared solid dispersion with a high concentration of silver NPs was exploited to prepare the standard Drosophila culture medium at a silver concentration range from 10 mg·L–1 to 100 mg·L–1 of Ag in the case of the acute toxicity testing and at a concentration equal to 5 mg·L–1 in the case of the chronic toxicity testing. The acute toxic effect of silver NPs on Drosophila melanogaster was observed for the silver concentration equal to 20 mg·L–1. At this silver concentration, 50% of the tested flies were unable to leave the pupae, and they did not finish their developmental cycle. Chronic toxicity of silver NPs was assessed by a long-term exposure of overall eight filial generations of Drosophila melanogaster to silver NPs. The long-term exposure to silver NPs influenced the fertility of Drosophila during the first three filial generations, nevertheless the fecundity of flies in subsequent generations consequently increased up to the level of the flies from the control sample due to the adaptability of flies to the silver NPs exposure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1523-1747.ep12275405,Effects of Synthetic Leukotrienes on Local Blood Flow and Vascular Permeability in Porcine Skin,"The local effects of synthetic leukotrienes (LT) were examined in the skin of the anesthetized pig. Blood flow was measured noninvasively with the use of a laser-Doppler flow meter and changes in vascular permeability were measured using technetium-labeled human serum albumin as a marker for extravasation. LTB4 and the peptidolipid leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, LTF4, induced vasodilator responses when injected intradermally at a dose of 1 ng. The vasodilator effects of LTB4 and LTF4 were comparable in magnitude to those of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and histamine and persisted over a wide dose range. Vascular permeability was induced by histamine, PGE2, and LTB4 but not by the other leukotrienes. The effects of LTB4 were significantly increased in the presence of PGE2. Leukotrienes appear not to produce their effects through the generation of prostaglandins as neither the vasodilator nor the permeability-enhancing effects were affected by treatment with indomethacin. The present investigation demonstrates that the pig is the first animal model to be described which reflects the potent vasodilator actions of leukotrienes in human skin. The porcine skin may thus be a useful model in the study of human skin diseases.",0

Like other second-generation antipsychotics, lurasidone is a powerful antagonist of D(2) dopamine and 5HT(2A) serotonin receptors, but differs from the other second-generation antipsychotics in its action profile for certain receptors. Lurasidone is the second-generation antipsychotic with the greatest affinity for 5HT(7) receptors and has a high affinity for 5HT(1A) serotonin receptors, compatible with favorable effects on cognitive function and an antidepressant action. By contrast, lurasidone has a low affinity for and α(1) α(2C)-adrenergic and 5HT(2C) serotonin receptors, and no affinity for histaminergic H(1) or muscarinic M(1) receptors, suggesting a better tolerability profile than the other second-generation antipsychotics. Lurasidone has demonstrated its efficacy in several short-term trials in acute schizophrenia, promptly and significantly reducing total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores compared with placebo. Several long-term studies are in progress to assess its efficacy in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenic patients. The efficacy of lurasidone with regard to cognitive functions and depressive symptoms seems good, but requires further work. Lurasidone differs from the other second-generation antipsychotics by having a good tolerability profile, in particular for cardiometabolic tolerability. However, it seems to have a significant although moderate link with the occurrence of akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and hyperprolactinemia at the start of treatment. This tolerance profile greatly broadens the scope of second-generation antipsychotics and so supports the view of some authors that the term ""second-generation antipsychotic"" is now outdated. Other therapeutic perspectives of lurasidone are assessed here, in particular bipolar depression.",0

Subsequently, the future expectancies of individuals at risk are often based on rough risk estimates such as 50% (child of an affected individual) or 25% (grandchild). Individuals at risk can be offered a better risk estimate based on their current age, length of the disease causing CAG-repeat in the HD gene in close relatives, information on the age at onset, or test results of children. Regression modelling and Cox regression determined relations between ages at onset and CAG repeat length in a sample of 755 tested individuals. A model for calculating the adjusted residual risk status was constructed and implemented in a spreadsheet that can be used in genetic counselling. This model and accompanying spreadsheet broadens the information repertoire for genetic counsellors by providing an optimal estimation of the residual risk status.",0

A sensitive and reproducible method was developed and validated for determination of ziprasidone and its major impurities, which are significantly different in polarity. The separation is performed on a Waters Spherisorb® octadecylsilyl 1 column (5.0 μm particle size, 250 × 4.6 mm id) using a gradient with mobile phase A [buffer–acetonitrile (80 + 20, v/v)] and mobile phase B [buffer–acetonitrile (10 + 90, v/v)] at a working temperature of 25°C. The buffer was 0.05 M KH2PO4 solution with an addition of 10 mL triethylamine/L solution, adjusted to pH 2.5 with orthophosphoric acid. The flow rate was 1.5 mL/min, and the eluate was monitored at 250 nm using a diode array detector. Optimization of the experimental conditions was performed using partial least squares regression, for which four factors were selected for optimization: buffer concentration, buffer pH, triethylamine concentration, and temperature. The proposed validated method is convenient and reliable for the assay and purity control in both raw materials and dosage forms.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esh057,A Deletion Affecting Several Gene Candidates is Present in the Evergrowing Peach Mutant,"Evergrowing (EVG) peach is one of only two described mutants affecting winter dormancy in woody perennial species. EVG peach does not set terminal buds, cease new leaf growth, nor enter into a dormant resting phase in response to winter conditions. The EVG mutation segregates in F2 progeny as a single recessive nuclear gene. A local molecular genetic linkage map around EVG was previously developed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig that contains the EVG mutation was assembled. A MADS box coding open reading frame (ORF) was found in a BAC of this contig and used as a probe. The probe detected a polymorphism between the wild-type and mutant genomes, and the polymorphism is indicative of a deletion in EVG peach. The EVG gene region contained six potential MADS-box transcription factor sequences, and the deletion in EVG affected at least four of these. The deletion was bracketed using RFLP analysis, which showed that it is contained within a segment of the genome no greater than 180 kb.",0

The [Ca2+]i measured by the Quin-2 technique rose immediately after the addition of the agonists and reached a maximal value after less than 30 seconds. Afterwards, the [Ca2+]i declined to a plateau higher than the basal level when the cells were triggered with carbachol. By contrast, in most experiments with PGF2 alpha and in the case of bradykinin, TRH, and ATP, the [Ca2+]i returned to the basal value. If the extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by excess of EGTA, the addition of all agents caused a sharp reduced transient rise in the [Ca2+]i followed by a decline of the [Ca2+]i often below the basal level (especially in the case of carbachol). It is suggested that the first transient phase of these responses is due at least in part to the mobilisation of Ca2+ from intracellular stores whereas the second sustained phase of the response to carbachol mainly originates from an increased Ca2+ influx into the thyrocytes. Carbachol, bradykinin, TRH, PGF2 alpha, and ATP also increased generation of inositol phosphates in dog thyrocytes. This effect was sustained when the cells were triggered with carbachol and was more transient with bradykinin, TRH, PGF2 alpha, or ATP. All these agents and the phorbdester TPA as well as forskolin enhanced to various extent the thyrocyte H2O2 generation. This enhancement was severely reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and was mimicked by Ca2+ ionophores in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ especially in synergy with protein kinase C activators. These data suggest that the dog thyrocyte H2O2 generation, the limiting step of the thyroid hormone synthesis, is modulated by carbachol, TRH, PGF2 alpha, bradykinin, and ATP through their action on the Ca2(+)-phosphatidylinositol cascade.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110191,Single gene inheritance of occurrence of head spots in mice,"Results from earlier selection studies indicated that while the size of head spots in mice descended from the Goodale head-spot strain was a quantitative, polygenic trait, head-spot occurrence was probably a qualitative trait inherited by one or two genes. The present study was undertaken to examine this possibility by crossing a head-spot stock with three inbred strains and with two noninbred stocks carrying mutant genes. Observed segregation ratios in the F2 and backcross generations of these crosses were compared to results expected under various models of qualitative inheritance. Evidence of linkage between known loci and a putative head-spot gene also was sought. Results indicated that head spotting was inherited primarily by the action of a recessive autosomal gene, head spot (hs). The action of this gene was subject to modification, in some crosses, by other genes or by environmental factors. Attempts to demonstrate linkage between the head spots and known single-locus traits were unsuccessful.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.76.2.8432796,Thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone stimulation test responses employing third and fourth generation TSH assays.,"TRH stimulation tests (n = 1109) were performed on 1061 ambulatory and 43 hospitalized patients with varying thyroid status, using a TSH immunochemiluminometric assay with third and fourth generation sensitivity characteristics (functional sensitivity, 0.01 and 0.001 mU/L, respectively). TRH test results were analyzed as both absolute (stimulated minus basal TSH) and fold (stimulated/basal TSH) responses. The absolute TRH response varied 8-fold across the physiological TSH range, whereas the mean fold response remained almost constant (mean +/- SEM, 8.5 +/- 0.2). The fold response became progressively attenuated as basal TSH values declined below physiological levels, becoming essentially absent in clinically thyrotoxic patients with markedly depressed basal serum TSH levels (0.007 +/- 0.002 mU/L). Progressive attenuation also occurred at hypothyroid TSH levels; a markedly impaired fold response (2.5 +/- 0.4) was characteristic of primary hypothyroid patients with basal TSH values greater than 50 mU/L. In untreated central hypothyroid patients with near-normal basal TSH levels, the TRH fold response was impaired (1.7 +/- 0.2), whereas in T4-replaced central hypothyroid patients, fold responses were near normal (5.6 +/- 1.2). Neither nonthyroidal illness, age, or sex appeared to influence the pattern of fold TRH response in the populations evaluated. When using third and fourth generation TSH methodology, the TRH-stimulated TSH fold response is more diagnostically useful than the absolute TRH response. However, if patients have an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis, there appears to be no diagnostic advantage gained by TRH testing over an accurately measured basal TSH value.",0

Third generation ELISA method as well as RIBA-3 were used. 5,978 donors in 1995 and 20,741 in the 1996–2000 period were analysed. The age of donors (prevalently male, 78.5%) was between 18 and 65 (median 38). A total of 110 borderline and 62 positives were found with ELISA, of which 75 borderlines and 42 positives in 1995, and the remaining in the 1996–2000 period (p > 0.5). Percentage of HCV antibodies dropped from 8.5% in 1995 to 5.45% in the 1996–2000 period. The non reactivity and undetermined status were found in 82.1 and 9.4% respectively in 1995, and 69.1 and 25.45% respectively in the 1996–2000 period. The incidence of HCV antibodies was 167.28 cases per 100,000 person-years in 1995 and 4.13 per 100,000 person-years in the 1996–2000 period, 2.5 times lower than the national one. There was a statistically significant association between dental care and RIBA positivity (RR: 2.63; p = 0.045).

Specific attention is paid to changes in the strength of transmission across cohorts. Theoretically, it is unclear whether the strength of intergenerational transmission of entry into parenthood can be expected to increase or to decrease across cohorts. Event history analyses of data in Dutch registers show a substantial degree of intergenerational transmission in the age at which people have their first child. The degree of transmission from mothers to children increases for successive cohorts. Intergenerational transmission becomes weaker the longer children postpone entry into parenthood. At young ages transmission from mothers to children is stronger than from fathers to children.",0
,[UV-induced DNA mutation of peach aphid].,"By using PCR technique and microsatellite marks, this paper studied the DNA polymorphism of peach aphid (Myzus persicae) under UV-radiation. The fragments of three primers were amplified, and the gene diversity and the rate of loci polymorphisms of their genomic DNA, which could reflect the damage degree of DNA after UV-radiation, were measured. The results revealed that after treated with different radiation intensity (15, 30, 45 W) and duration (2, 4, 6 h) , the UV-induced DNA mutations were genetic and could be delivered to F2 generation. The mutations depended on the interaction of radiation intensity and duration. Variance analysis on the gene diversity and the rate of loci polymorphisms showed that there existed a significant difference between UV-treated and control groups, except the rate of loci polymorphisms under 2 h radiation. The average value of the control was higher than that of 2 h radiation treatment. According to the cluster analysis of the genetic distance, the aphids were divided into three groups, i. e., control group, 2 h (15, 30 W) treatment group, and the other, which was consistent with the result of variance analysis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.006,Male Germline Transmits Fetal Alcohol Adverse Effect on Hypothalamic Proopiomelanocortin Gene Across Generations,"Neurons containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, known to control stress axis, metabolic, and immune functions, have a lower function in patients with a family history of alcoholism, raising the possibility that alcohol effects on the POMC system may transmit through generations. Here we describe epigenetic modifications of Pomc gene that transmit through generation via male germline and may be critically involved in alcoholism-inherited diseases.Whether an epigenetic mechanism is involved in causing a Pomc expression deficit in fetal alcohol-exposed rats is studied by determining Pomc gene methylation, expression, and functional abnormalities and their normalization following suppression of DNA methylation or histone acetylation. Additionally, transgenerational studies were conducted to evaluate the germline-transmitted effect of alcohol.Fetal alcohol-exposed male and female rat offspring showed a significant deficit in POMC neuronal functions. Associated with this was an increased methylation status of several CpG dinucleotides in the proximal part of the Pomc promoter region and altered level of histone-modifying proteins and DNA methyltransferases levels in POMC neurons. Suppression of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation normalized Pomc expression and functional abnormalities. Fetal alcohol-induced Pomc gene methylation, expression, and functional defects persisted in the F2 and F3 male but not in female germline. Additionally, the hypermethylated Pomc gene was detected in sperm of fetal alcohol-exposed F1 offspring that was transmitted through F3 generation via male germline.Trangenerational epigenetic studies should spur new insight into the biological mechanisms that influence the sex-dependent difference in genetic risk of alcoholism-inherited diseases.",1

Their custom of marrying only among relatives has kept the genetic homogeneity of the families intact. There were ten cases of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) and nine cases of adult limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) belonging to two generations of the same family. Both forms showed autosomal recessive inheritance. The patients with congenital muscular dystrophy had generalized muscular weakness and hypotonia at birth without arthrogryposis or CNS involvement and then had a relatively benign evolution with stabilization of the clinical picture at different ages and variable degree of severity. Muscle biopsy showed a dystrophic pattern. The other nine patients presented with the picture of adult limb-girdle muscular dystrophy but with an unusual tendency to the stabilization of symptoms.",0

These communities are geographically and culturally isolated; parents and grandparents were born in the community. Our data show that 98.6% of the mtDNA was distributed in haplogroups A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, and D2. Haplotype X6 was present in the Tarahumara (1/53) and Huichol (3/15), and haplotype L was present in the Nahua-Coyolillo (3/38). The first two principal components accounted for 95.9% of the total variation in the sample. The mtDNA haplogroup frequencies in the Purépecha and Zitlala were intermediate to cluster 1 (Otomi, Nahua-Ixhuatlancillo, Nahua-Xochimilco, Mixteca-Baja, and Tzeltal) and cluster 2 (Nahua-Necoxtla, Nahua-Atocpan, and Nahua-Chilacachapa). The Huichol, Tarahumara, Mixteca-Alta, and Nahua-Coyolillo were separated from the rest of the populations.

https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/120.4.331,Effect of Vitamin E on Linoleic Acid-Mediated Induction of Peroxisomal Enzymes in Cultured Porcine Endothelial Cells,"Linoleic acid decreases endothelial barrier function in culture. We hypothesize that the mechanism may involve induction of peroxisomes, with subsequent generation of hydrogen peroxide, and that vitamin E may protect against barrier function loss by preventing the induction of peroxisomal enzymes. To investigate this hypothesis, we exposed cultured endothelial cells to 0 or 90 mumols/L linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)], with or without 25 mumols/L supplemental vitamin E, for 5 d. The induction of peroxisomes by linoleic acid exposure was determined by measuring cellular peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity. Vitamin E alone had no effect on beta-oxidation or catalase activity, whereas linoleic acid exposure significantly increased both compared with control values. Vitamin E supplementation prevented induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity by 18:2. In contrast, cell enrichment with vitamin E had no effect on 18:2-induced accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid-like droplets. These results confirm our hypothesis that the protective effects of vitamin E against fatty acid-mediated endothelial cell injury may be due in part to the ability of vitamin E to prevent the induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and thus the formation of excess hydrogen peroxide.",0

However, it is also possible that lack or excess of a particular chromosomal segment is a neutral polymorphism among populations and thus does not cause obvious abnormal phenotype. In this study, conventional GTG-banded karyotyping and molecular cytogenetic analyses (including fluorescence in situ hybridization, spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization) were applied to study the genotype–phenotype correlation in a Taiwanese family, in which a concomitant segregation of del(13)(q31q31) interstitial deletion and t(13;18)(q32;p11.2) reciprocal translocation in a 2-year-old girl (the proband) was noticed. Two family members (the father and grandmother of the proband) who carried the del(13)(q31q31) but not the translocation t(13;18) both revealed a normal phenotype at adulthood. The finding, which appears novel, that interstitial deletion 13q31 could be associated with a normal phenotype, is therefore valuable in genetic counseling.",0

The increased resistance to fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin/clavulanate of this pathogen mandates the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) or third generation cephalosporins (3GC).To assess incidence and impact on clinical outcome of infections with PIP-TAZ resistant E. coli in ICU patients, we conducted a retrospective cohort study with infections due to PIP-TAZ resistant (PIP-TAZ R) or to PIP-TAZ susceptible strains (PIP-TAZ S) between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2004.Of 83 strains, 13 were PIP-TAZ R: 2 strains produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (2%), 11 produced a high level penicillinase (13%). Prior amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate prescription was reported in 7 cases (54%) of infections with PIP-TAZ R isolates and in 15 cases (21%) of infections with PIP-TAZ S isolates (p = 0.03). Time of onset of the infection from hospital admission was longer in case of infections with PIP-TAZ R than with PIP-TAZ S isolates (22 +/- 32 vs 10 +/- 21 days, p = 0.01). The overall ICU mortality rate was 38%. Mortality and length of stay in ICU were similar in case of infections with PIP-TAZ R isolates and with PIP-TAZ S isolates.Infections with PIP-TAZ R E. coli are frequent in ICU patients. No prognostic impact of this pattern of resistance was found. Prescription of PIP-TAZ for empirical treatment of E. coli infections in ICU however exposes to inappropriate therapy.",0

Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs), to which polecats are exposed by eating contaminated prey, are used more extensively in these central and eastern regions, leading to fears of increased exposure, and possible resultant mortality. We measured bromadiolone, difenacoum, flocoumafen and brodifacoum concentrations in the livers of 50 polecats from areas that included newly recolonised habitats and found that at least one SGAR was detected in the livers of 13 out of 37 (35.1%) male and 5 out of 13 (38.5%) female polecats. Difenacoum and bromadiolone were detected most frequently. We then combined these data with measurements on another 50 individuals from earlier studies to create a dataset for 100 polecats collected throughout the 1990s from across the whole of their current range. Using this dataset, we determined if there was any evidence that contamination in polecats had increased during the 1990s and whether animals from England were more contaminated than those from Wales, as might be expected given regional differences in the patterns of SGAR use. Overall, 31 of the 100 polecats analysed to date contained SGAR residues. The incidence was a little higher (40%) in animals that died between January and June and this probably better reflects the overall proportion of animals that are sub-lethally exposed. There was no statistically significant change during the 1990s in the proportion of polecats exposed to SGARs nor any evidence that greater use of SGARs in England resulted in more contamination of polecats. Contrary to expectation, the proportion of animals that contained difenacoum was marginally higher in Wales than elsewhere.",0
https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2003-10-3721,Genetic variation responsible for mouse strain differences in integrin α2 expression is associated with altered platelet responses to collagen,"Abstract As mouse models have become commonplace for studying hemostasis and thrombosis, we considered whether the mouse system had utility for assessing genetic alterations in platelet receptors. Platelets from 5 mouse strains (C57BL/6 [C57], FVB/N [FVB], BALB/c, C3H/He, and 129Sv) showed only minor differences in the expression of integrin αIIb, integrin β3, glycoprotein (GP) Ibα, or GPVI across strains. However, FVB platelets expressed approximately 50% the level of integrin α2 as platelets from other strains (P &amp;lt; .0001). We bred FVB mice with C57 and assessed α2 expression in FVB/C57xFVB/C57 (F2) offspring. Linkage analysis demonstrated the gene responsible for α2 levels is tightly linked to the D13mit260 marker (log odds [lod] score 6.7) near the α2 gene. FVB platelets showed reduced aggregation and a longer lag phase to collagen. FVB and C57 platelets aggregated similarly to collagen-related peptide, but FVB platelets showed a reduction in rhodocytin-induced Syk and PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, FVB platelets express half the level of α2 as other mouse strains, a trait linked to the α2 gene and seemingly responsible for reduced platelet aggregation to collagen. These strain differences serve as a useful model for the 2-fold difference in human platelet α2β1 expression and demonstrate that α2β1 participates in signaling during platelet activation.

Glimepiride improves metabolic control comparable but not superior to other (second generation) SU derivatives. Although it has been advocated for once-daily use, maximum effect is presumably achieved by twice-daily dosing. One of the most important side-effects of SU remains hypoglycemia in some patients, which may last for several hours. Although there is some indication that the use of glimepiride leads to fewer hypoglycemic episodes than glibenclamide, the differences reported sofar are not statistically significant.",0

Its natural population has been continuously declining in the past several decades. Microsatellite DNA markers are useful DNA-based tool for monitoring Pacific threadfin populations. In this study, fifteen Microsatellite (MS) DNA markers were identified from a partial genomic Pacific threadfin DNA library enriched in CA repeats, and six highly-polymorphic microsatellite loci were employed to analyze genetic similarity and differences between the wild population and hatchery population in Oahu Island. A total of 37 alleles were detected at the six MS loci in the two populations. Statistical analysis of fixation index (F(ST)) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed no genetic differentiation between the wild and hatchery populations (F(ST) = 0.001, CI(95%) = -0.01-0.021). Both high genetic diversity (H(o) = 0.664-0.674 and H(e) = 0.710-0.715) and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed in the wild and hatchery populations. Results of genetic bottleneck analysis indicated that the hatchery was founded with sufficient numbers of brooders as inbreeding coefficient is very low (F(IS) = 0.052-0.072) in both wild and hatchery populations. Further studies are needed for comprehensive determinations of genetic varieties of primary founder broodstocks and successive offspring of the hatchery and wild populations with increased number of Pacific threadfin sample collections.",0

Four generations of offspring were bred on a soy protein-free diet (F1, F2, F3, and F4 groups). RB and F4 animals were exposed to soy protein either ad libitum through drinking water or parenterally with an adjuvant.In the F0 and F1 animals soy protein-specific IgG antibodies were still detectable, whereas no soy protein-specific IgG was detectable in the other generations tested. In RB animals no significant increase in soy protein-specific IgG titers occurred after exposure to soy protein. Enteral exposure of the F4 animals to soy protein resulted in sensitization to soy protein, with increased soy protein-specific IgG titers.These studies demonstrate that there is a continued expression of anti-soy protein antibodies in rats bred and raised on a soy protein-free diet for one generation. Not only must the test animals be bred and raised on a specified antigen-free diet, but their parental generations must also be bred in the same manner to avoid any problems in oral sensitization studies.",0

One- and 2-mm contiguous slices were obtained, using a third generation CT scanner Individual images were reviewed, using bone (window width = 3,500 Hounsfield units; window level = 500 Hounsfield units) and soft-tissue (window width = 400 Hounsfield units; window level = 66 Hounsfield units) settings. After euthanasia, the hind limbs from the Bullmastiff were removed and frozen at -18 C. Tarsal joints were sectioned into approximately 1-mm-thick slab sections, using a cryomicrotome. Anatomic sections were photographed and compared with the corresponding CT images. Computed tomographic reconstructions of the tarsocrural joint were created in sagittal and dorsal planes.Structures on the CT images were matched with structures in the corresponding anatomic sections. The entire tarsocrural joint surface could be evaluated on the reconstructed images in the sagittal and dorsal planes.CT images provide full anatomic detail of the bony structures of the tarsal joint in dogs. Tendons and large blood vessels can also be evaluated. These results could be used as a basis for evaluation of CT images of the hind limbs of dogs with tarsal joint injuries.",0

https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s19055,Treating metastatic soft-tissue or bone sarcomas &ndash; potential role of ridaforolimus,Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone are a rare group of cancers hallmarked by relative insensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The development of targeted therapies in the treatment of sarcoma has been difficult due to the significant heterogeneity and rarity of these diseases. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as an exciting treatment approach and is being studied extensively in sarcoma patients. Ridaforolimus is a second generation mTOR inhibitor that has shown potential benefit in the treatment of sarcoma. Recently a Phase III study demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival when patients with at least stable disease after treatment with standard chemotherapy received maintenance ridaforolimus compared to placebo. The results of this study show that mTOR is an important pathway in soft tissue and bone sarcomas and represents an exciting opportunity for the improvement in the treatment of our patients.,0
https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1229277,Germline DNA Demethylation Dynamics and Imprint Erasure Through 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine,"Epigenetic Controls Germ cells in mammals give rise to sperm and eggs. During their development, germ cells undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming, including global DNA demethylation, which is vital for the totipotency of the developing embryo. Hackett et al. (p. 448 ) show that the enzymes Tet1 and Tet2 are involved in the demethylation of individual genes and in imprinted gametic differentially methylated regions. The enzymes were also responsible for the global conversion of CpG methylation to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which then progressively declines. The findings suggest that demethylation can occur by replication-coupled dilution, although active mechanisms cannot be excluded. A small number of loci escape demethylation, providing a possible mechanistic basis for transgenerational inheritance.",1

We used automated startle boxes to compare the effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropyl-amino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), on PPI in three mouse strains. Balb/c mice were then pretreated with antipsychotics, treated with 8-OH-DPAT or saline, and tested for PPI. 8-OH-DPAT treatment dose dependently increased PPI in Balb/c mice, but had less effect in 129Sv and C57Bl/6 mice. In Balb/c mice, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by the typical antipsychotic and dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol and the third generation antipsychotic, aripiprazole, which has activity at both 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors. The atypical antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, had lesser effects. Similar to our earlier studies in rats, the present PPI results suggest that 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the action of some antipsychotic drugs in mice. Despite strain and species differences in the magnitude and direction of the effect of 8-OH-DPAT, downstream dopamine D2 receptor activation seems to be an important mediator. These comparative results allow a theoretical framework of receptor interactions, which may guide further studies on the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in schizophrenia.",0

,[Comparative study of intravenous ceftriaxone followed by oral cefixime versus ceftriaxone alone in the treatment of severe upper urinary tract infections].,"Cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin. Its MICs and beta-lactamase stability are similar to those of the parenteral third generation cephalosporins. This trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness and safety of ceftriaxone as compared with a treatment where oral cefixime was given after a 4-day treatment with ceftriaxone in severe upper urinary tract infections usually requiring parenteral treatment during two weeks. In an open, controlled trial, 95 patients met the inclusion criteria; 48 received IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily during 4 days, followed by IM or IV ceftriaxone 1 g daily for 11 days; 47 patients were treated by IV ceftriaxone 2 g.o.d. during 4 days and then by oral cefixime 200 mg b.i.d. for 11 days. Clinical cure at the end of treatment was achieved in 44 patients in the cefixime group and 47 patients of the ceftriaxone group. Ten to 84 days after the end of treatment, the overall clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication rates for these patients were 74.3 per cent (29/39) for cefixime and 81 per cent (34/42) for ceftriaxone. Treatment failure occurred in two patients in the cefixime arm, one in a patient with renal atrophy and vascular stenosis and the other in an 86-year old diabetic and bed-ridden woman with an infection following the use of a urinary catheter. There were eight relapses or re-infections (about 20 per cent) in each group. Seven minor adverse events were seen in six patients treated with ceftriaxone: pain upon IM injection (3 cases), diarrhea (2 cases) associated in one case with a generalized rash for which treatment was discontinued, and nausea (one case). Laboratory changes in both groups were not noteworthy and without clinical relevance. These results suggest that it seems possible to propose new parenteral cephalosporins with conversion to the oral route on the 5th day using the same class of drugs in the treatment of severe upper urinary tract infections, excluding certain urological or vascular underlying conditions and provided that duration of treatment is adapted to the type of clinical setting. These data define more accurately the use of cefixime with respect to currently available drugs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.1993.47,A pharmacokinetic evaluation of the second-generation H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine in very young children,"The pharmacokinetics of the second-generation H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine was studied in eight children younger than 4 years of age who were treated with a single dose of cetirizine solution (5 mg). These children were hospitalized with suspected allergic respiratory problems or recurrent respiratory tract infections. Blood samples were collected at 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours, and a 24-hour urine collection was performed in five of the samples. The findings obtained in children were compared with those obtained in 16 healthy young adults (mean +/- SD, 24.6 +/- 4.1 years) who received a single 20 mg dose. Cetirizine was absorbed more slowly in children (p = 0.006; mean +/- SD, 1.44 +/- 1.12 hours) than in adults (0.62 +/- 0.22 hours). The plasma elimination half-life of cetirizine was significantly shorter in children (p < 0.001; 4.91 +/- 0.6 hours) than in adults (8.6 +/- 2.1 hours), and the clearance rate was significantly higher in children (p < 0.001; 1.48 +/- 0.41 ml/min/kg) than in adults (0.80 +/- 0.17 ml/min/kg). Urinary excretion of unchanged cetirizine was significantly lower in children (p < 0.001; 37.8% +/- 5.2%; n = 5) than in adults (57.7% +/- 11.8%). Therefore the metabolism of cetirizine is faster in young children than in adults. This effect must be taken into account in future pharmacodynamic studies in this age group.",0

As a group, these agents share the pharmacologic property of modulating cellular response to ligand activation, the precise biologic effect of which is cell lineage and stimulant-dependent. Lenalidomide (CC-5013; Revlimid), a second generation IMiD, has shown significant erythropoietic activity in patients with lower risk MDS that have failed or are not candidates for recombinant erythropoietin treatment. Unlike cytokine therapy, lenalidomide suppresses select MDS clones and enhances erythropoietin receptor signaling to restore erythropoiesis. Activity is greatest in patients with interstitial deletions involving chromosome 5q31.1. A multicenter phase II study reported a 76 % overall transfusion response rate in transfusion-dependent patients with deletion 5q, with 67 % achieving transfusion independence after a median interval of 4.6 weeks of treatment. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 73% of patients with complete cytogenetic remission in 45% patients. Both transfusion response and cytogenetic response frequency were independent of karyotype complexity, raising excitement that this new treatment strategy might favorably alter the natural history of disease in higher risk patients with deletion 5q. Lenalidomide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 27, 2005, for the treatment of IPSS Low and intermediate-1 risk MDS patients with del(5q) abnormality. A phase III Intergroup trial (ECOG 2905) will test the capacity to potentiate erythropoietin response by comparing response to lenalidomide monotherapy to the combination of darbepoetin and lenalidomide in non-deletion 5q MDS patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.145.1.365,Vaccination with membrane-associated idiotype provides greater and more prolonged protection of animals from tumor challenge than the soluble form of idiotype.,"The purpose of this work was to compare the efficacy of immunizing mice with a soluble vs a cell-associated form of a tumor Ag. A murine B cell tumor (2C3), which displays an Id on its cell surface, grows progressively and gives rise to Id-negative tumor variants in nonimmunized animals. We previously reported that the tumor variants arise as a consequence of Id-specific T cell suppression of the Id+ tumor. The Id-specific effector T cells are CD4+, CD8-. Based upon these findings vaccination protocols have been designed and tested to determine whether the expansion of tumor-specific effector T cells would eliminate the Id+ tumors and prevent the subsequent generation of Id- tumor variants in vivo. MHC-restricted T cells typically recognize soluble Ag subsequent to modification by an APC, and APC may ultimately express a processed form of the Ag that is different from that expressed on the surface of the tumor cells. Based upon this assumption, the efficacy of immunizing mice with cell-associated 2C3 Id was compared to immunization with a soluble form of the same Id. Mice were immunized with either irradiated 2C3 cells or syngeneic spleen cells to which 2C3 protein was covalently linked. These immunization protocols provided a complete and lasting protection against a tumor challenge of up to 1 x 10(6) tumor cells. In contrast, most mice hyperimmunized with a soluble form of the Id did not survive this level of tumor challenge in spite of the production of significant levels of anti-Id antibodies. Mice immunized with the soluble form of the Id, which did survive, produced slowly progressing tumors expressing a 1000-fold less of the marker Id. These results illustrate the importance of understanding and properly exploiting a host's natural response to a tumor-specific Ag when designing effective immunization protocols for cancer therapy.",0

The extent of disease was defined according to standard staging techniques, including bilateral bone-core biopsies in 88 percent of patients. Randomization was stratified according to age (< 60 or > or = 60 years), performance status (0, 1, or other), stage (III or IV), and histologic presentation (diffuse mixed or diffuse large-cell lymphoma).After a median follow-up of four years, there were no significant differences in rates of complete remission, time to treatment failure, disease-free survival, or overall survival in the patients treated with CHOP as compared with those treated with m-BACOD. However, there was more severe and life-threatening pulmonary, infectious, and hematologic toxicity associated with the m-BACOD regimen. In an attempt to measure the importance of dose intensity in the 325 patients who could be analyzed, we retrospectively calculated dose intensity (measured in milligrams per square meter of body-surface area per week) and normalized dose intensity (defined as a percentage of the prescribed dose) for all drugs. The median normalized dose intensity for both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin was found to be greater in the patients treated with CHOP than in those treated with m-BACOD.For patients with stage III or IV diffuse mixed or diffuse large-cell lymphoma, CHOP is superior to m-BACOD, but the role of dose intensity is not yet clear.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.136.3.7867588,Selective uptake of estrogenic compounds by Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a mechanism for antiestrogen resistance in yeast expressing the mammalian estrogen receptor.,"Estrogen antagonists such as ICI164,384 do not inhibit 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-dependent gene activity in yeast expressing the mammalian estrogen receptor although these compounds bind to receptors isolated from these cells. Various explanations have been offered for antiestrogen resistance in yeast systems including differences in cell-specific components and lack of permeability of the yeast cell wall to these compounds. We have used a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with the human estrogen receptor gene, and two estrogen response elements linked to a lacZ reporter gene to study the pharmacology of estrogen agonists and antagonists. The rank order of potency of estrogen agonists in this strain (CY525) is similar to that in estrogen-dependent mammalian cells: DES > or = E2 > E1 > E3 = zeranol. Competitive binding with 3H-E2 by these compounds in cell-free extracts of CY525 results in a similar order of potency with a reverse order for E1 and E3. The pure estrogen antagonist ICI164,384 also binds to the receptor from cell-free extracts of CY525 with an IC50 of approximately 14nM. As in mammalian cells ICI164,384 does not induce E2-dependent gene activity. However, unlike mammalian cells, E2-induced gene activity in CY525 is not inhibited by ICI164,384. Intact CY525 cells incubated with 3H-17 beta estradiol were found to specifically bind the labeled ligand since excess unlabeled E2 effectively competed for binding. Unlabeled DES and E1 were also found to compete, however, excess unlabeled ICI164,384, E3 and the second generation antagonist ICI182,720 were unable to displace 3H-E2 binding in intact cells. These results indicate that certain compounds enter the intact yeast cell more readily than others and offer an explanation for antagonist resistance in these organisms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10823-010-9116-8,Remembering Sacrifices: Attitude and Beliefs Among Second-generation Korean Americans Regarding Family Support,"Korean immigration peaked in the mid-1980s, so that large cohorts of post-1965 immigrants are now approaching or entering retirement. As the baby boomer generation ages, few studies have examined how the lack of retirement savings and eldercare plans combined with cultural expectations such as filial piety may pose challenges for aging Korean immigrants and their adult children. This exploratory study examines attitudes and beliefs among 1.5 and 2nd generation Korean American adults regarding filial expectations and support for aging immigrant parents. In-depth interviews conducted with 124 adult children of immigrants show that their attitudes and beliefs around filial care were primarily motivated by feelings of gratitude and a strong sense of responsibility toward their parents. In addition, because Korean immigrant parents often face language and financial barriers, adult children were preparing themselves for future support of their parents' finances, health care and long-term care needs. Although both adult sons and daughters expressed a desire to care for their parents, adult daughters often discussed in detail their concerns and worries about future care of their parents. The findings of this paper illustrate how the intersections of gender, culture, and class inform attitudes and beliefs regarding aging and family support among Korean American families.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01377-5,Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance,"What is it? If you thought all heritable traits are written in the DNA sequence, think again! We have come to realize that, at some alleles, the epigenetic state of the DNA can also be inherited. This is indicated by analysis of alleles where the establishment of the epigenetic state is stochastic. As epigenetic modifications influence transcriptional activity, these alleles are variably expressed in a population of individuals. It has been shown that the epigenetic state, and associated phenotype, can be inherited transgenerationally.What is the physical nature of epigenetic modifications? They include DNA methylation and/or covalent modifications of histone proteins. Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression but do not change the DNA sequence, and are mitotically relatively stable.What is variable expressivity? In general, the establishment of epigenetic modifications at mammalian alleles during early development is a predictable process. At some alleles, however, the establishment is stochastic. Once established, the epigenetic state is maintained throughout the life of the individual. So identical alleles can be variably expressed in a population and, importantly, this is not due to genetic or environmental heterogeneity. Such alleles are referred to as ‘metastable epialleles’.How does epigenetic inheritance occur? There is genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. It was thought this would erase epigenetic modifications acquired during the life of the animal, in order to restore the totipotency of the fertilized egg. But it turns out that sometimes epigenetic modifications at variably expressed alleles are not completely erased, resulting in some memory of the epigenetic state persisting in the next generation.How about an example? The coats of isogenic mice carrying the agouti viable-yellow (Avy) allele vary from completely yellow to the wild-type agouti. Avy has a retrotransposon upstream of the agouti gene. An unmethylated retrotransposon promoter overrides the agouti promoter, resulting in ectopic agouti expression and a yellow coat. A methylated retrotransposon cannot do this, resulting in a wild-type agouti coat. Yellow mothers produce more yellow offspring than agouti mothers, even when all the mice are genetically identical – transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic states has also been demonstrated in plants, yeast, Drosophila and in mice after transgenesis and nuclear transfer.Isn't parental imprinting also epigenetic inheritance? No! Parental imprinting is the epigenetic silencing of one allele of a gene based on the parent of origin, resulting in monoallelic expression in somatic cells. Epigenetic differences between the two alleles of parentally imprinted genes are completely erased through meiosis and then re-established according to the sex of the animal. For paternally expressed genes, for example, males transmit active alleles, whereas females transmit inactive alleles.What is the difference between transgenerational and mitotic epigenetic inheritance? Epigenetic modifications are propagated through mitotic cell divisions and this is sometimes called epigenetic inheritance. It is important to distinguish mitotic epigenetic inheritance from transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic states through meiotic cell divisions.What is the take-home message? Genotype and environment are not the only determinants of phenotype and DNA is not the sole unit of heredity. It is hard to estimate how widespread epigenetic inheritance is, but such effects seem to be associated with retrotransposon insertions. It is worth noting that almost 9% of the human genome is thought to be of retroviral origin. Studies of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans have been confounded by our extreme genetic and environmental heterogeneity, but it is not inconceivable that some heritable characteristics in humans may in fact have an epigenetic basis.",1
,Effect of different progestagens in low oestrogen oral contraceptives on venous thromboembolic disease. World Health Organization Collaborative Study of Cardiovascular Disease and Steroid Hormone Contraception.,"A multinational hospital-based case-control study of the risk of venous thromboembolic disease associated with combined oral contraceptives (OCs) done in 1989-93 prompted a separate inquiry comparing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with low oestrogen (< 35 micrograms ethinyloestradiol) OCs containing levonorgestrel with risks in low oestrogen preparations containing the third-generation progestagens desogestrel or gestodene. This analysis of data from 9 countries, involved 769 cases and 1979 age matched hospital controls and, in one centre, 246 community controls matched on age and general practice. 137 cases and 203 controls were current users of levonorgestrel (odds ratio [OR with 95% confidence interval] 3.5 [2.6-4.7]), with non-users as the reference; 35 cases and 28 controls were current users of desogestrel (9.1 [4.9-17.0]), and 36 cases and 28 controls were current users of gestodene (9.1 [4.9-16.7]). The ratios of these risks, compared with levonorgestrel, were 2.6 (1.4-4.8) for both products separately. Risk estimates adjusted for body mass index (BMI) were 3.4, 7.3, and 10.2 for levonorgestrel, desogestrel, and gestodene, respectively, compared with non-users, and 2.2 and 3.0 for desogestrel and gestodene, respectively, compared with levonorgestrel. 48 (68%) cases and 48 (86%) controls exposed to desogestrel or gestodene were from the UK (Oxford region). In this centre risk estimates compared with non-users, adjusted for BMI, were 2.6, 5.3, and 5.7 for levonorgestrel, desogestrel, and gestodene, respectively. Current users of low oestrogen dose combined OCs containing desogestrel or gestodene appear to be at higher risk of VTE than users of combined OCs containing levonorgestrel. The possibility that these unexpected results on a secondary study objective are due to chance, bias, or residual confounding cannot be excluded entirely and the results need to be confirmed by independent studies. They are at variance with the apparently more favourable metabolic effects of the newer progestagens. Whether the new progestagens are associated with lower risk of arterial disease (stroke and myocardial infarction) must be evaluated further.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2003.11.033,Lessons learned from perinatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol,"The synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) is well documented to be a perinatal carcinogen in both humans and experimental animals. Exposure to DES during critical periods of differentiation permanently alters the programming of estrogen target tissues resulting in benign and malignant abnormalities in the reproductive tract later in life. Using the perinatal DES-exposed rodent model, cellular and molecular mechanisms have been identified that play a role in these carcinogenic effects. Although DES is a potent estrogenic chemical, effects of low doses of the compound are being used to predict health risks of weaker environmental estrogens. Therefore, it is of particular interest that developmental exposure to very low doses of DES has been found to adversely affect fertility and to increase tumor incidence in murine reproductive tract tissues. These adverse effects are seen at environmentally relevant estrogen dose levels. New studies from our lab verify that DES effects are not unique; when numerous environmental chemicals with weak estrogenic activity are tested in the experimental neonatal mouse model, developmental exposure results in an increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors including uterine leiomyomas and adenocarcinomas that are similar to those shown following DES exposure. Finally, growing evidence in experimental animals suggests that some adverse effects can be passed on to subsequent generations, although the mechanisms involved in these trans-generational events remain unknown. Although the complete spectrum of risks to DES-exposed humans are uncertain at this time, the scientific community continues to learn more about cellular and molecular mechanisms by which perinatal carcinogenesis occurs. These advances in knowledge of both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms will be significant in ultimately predicting risks to other environmental estrogens and understanding more about the role of estrogens in normal and abnormal development.",1

Exploratory study was undertaken with a racially diverse group of custodial grandfathers to fill a gap in the literature about the vulnerability for elder abuse, exploitation and neglect as expressed by older Black, Latino and White custodial grandfathers. To provide a more inclusive understanding of elder abuse, areas of vulnerability were identified for consideration by practitioners, educators and researchers. The implications of this research point to the need to rethink elder abuse assessment, prevention and intervention strategies with older men.",0

Akey dilemma of the profession is how to interest and educate undergraduate social work students in aging and gerontology so that the needs of elderly can be supported. Social Work students notoriously are primarily interested in working with children and adolescents. With the support of the John A. Hartford Foundation's Geriatric Enrichment in Social Work Education grant, the authors developed a Spiral Perspective to infuse intergenerational content into the curriculum of their department and to give students exposure to geriatric content throughout their educational experience.",0
,Interrelationships between zinc and immune function.,"Zinc deficiency is a common nutritional problem observed both in human and in animal populations that has profound effects on host defense mechanisms. Using the young adult mouse as a model, it has been demonstrated that a moderate period of suboptimal zinc causes thymic atrophy, lymphopenia, and alterations in the proportions of the various subsets of lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. As a result, antibody-mediated responses to both T cell-dependent and T cell independent antigens are significantly reduced. Cytolytic T cell responses, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions are also depressed. Suboptimal zinc during in utero development of mice causes persistent states of immunodeficiency in the offspring that can even be transferred to subsequent generations. In regard to human immunological consequences of zinc deficiency, patients with the genetic disorder of zinc absorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, also exhibit atrophic thymuses, lymphopenia, anergic DTH responses, and reduced NK cell activity. Patients suffering from sickle cell anemia or uremia with associated deficiencies in zinc exhibit similar immune deficiencies. An additional outcome of these studies has been shown to be an essential cofactor for thymulin, one of the thymic hormones. Furthermore, addition of zinc salts to culture can polyclonally activate lymphocytes as well as augment responses to mitogens in adjuvant-like manner.",1

Objetivou-se avaliar e comparar a atitude em relação à velhice de crianças morando com idosos com e sem alterações cognitivas. Realizaram-se entrevistas domiciliares com 54 crianças de cinco USF, 25 morando com idosos com alterações cognitivas (grupo 1) e 29 com idosos sem alterações cognitivas (grupo 2). Os cuidados éticos foram observados. Aplicou-se a Escala de Atitudes em Relação à Velhice para Crianças, na qual a pontuação média foi de 1,66 pontos (grupo 1) e 1,52 (grupo 2). Um ponto representava a pontuação mais positiva e três pontos a mais negativa possível. Comparando os grupos, os domínios cognição e relacionamento social apresentaram índices significativos, indicando que crianças convivendo com idosos com alteração cognitiva têm atitudes mais negativas nestes domínios. Profissionais de saúde na atenção básica devem atentar-se às famílias multigeracionais e investir na educação das mesmas.",0
,[Gemcitabine and non small-cell lung cancer].,"Questions raised during gemcitabine development reflect non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) history during last 10 years. Third generation therapies (gemcitabine, vinorelbine and taxanes) combined with platinium compounds are now to be prescribed in almost all clinical situations, from surgically removed tumors to metastatic diseases. The 30% response rate usually reported in advanced disease (with a median survival of 10 months) has to be improved and a more global approach is nowadays mandatory, including targeted agents. This review sum-up the clinical situations in which gemcitabine can be prescribed (advanced disease), or shall be prescribed (adjuvant setting, combination with anti-angiogenic agent or EGFR inhibitors), and highlight opening questions.",0
,[Functional outcome in schizophrenia: a comparative cross-sectional study on first versus second generation antipsychotics].,"The purpose of this study was to compare outpatients with stable schizophrenia who were treated with either first or second generation antipsychotics in terms of executive functions, social functioning and quality of life.One-hundred and sixty-eight consecutive outpatients with stable schizophrenia were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. At the time of assessment all patients were receiving antipsychotic medication with first (FGAs) or second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Executive functions were evaluated by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). We adopted the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), in order to assess psychological, social and occupational functioning, and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS), to evaluate patients' quality of life. The one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used to compare the two treatment groups with respect to all variables.Sixty-seven patients (40%) were on treatment with FGAs, while 101 patients (60%) were treated with SGAs. Patients treated with SGAs showed better results at WCST, in particular a significantly higher number of completed categories (p=0.009) and a lower percentage of perseverative errors (p=0.001). The subpopulation on SGAs treatment had significantly higher scores at the GAF scale (p=0.004) and at subscale of the QLS evaluating the instrumental role of patients (p=0.043).The results of our study suggest that patients treated with SGAs present better outcomes in terms of neurocognition, social functioning and working skills.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e328340cf94,Targeted therapies for advanced thyroid cancer,"Thyroid cancer incidence has significantly increased and the majority of cases are represented by differentiated thyroid carcinomas that are characterized by a very good prognosis. Nevertheless, after initial treatment up to 15% of patients present disease persistence or relapse and those with locally advanced or metastasized cancers that do not respond to established therapies ultimately risk death. This scenario has started to change following the development of molecular targeted therapies. This review will focus on the principles behind the use of these novel therapies and on the results of the most recent clinical trials with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other targeted therapies in thyroid cancer.An understanding of the molecular events involved in cancer formation has prompted the development of numerous drugs that target key molecules implicated in angiogenesis and in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. The results of several phase I and phase II studies and one phase III trial testing the efficacy of these drugs in advanced thyroid cancer are now available.Among the tested drugs, the TKIs sorafenib for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and vandetanib and XL184 for medullary thyroid carcinoma appear very effective and have reached phase III clinical trials. Second-generation TKIs and selective kinase inhibitors are showing even more promising profiles. Improved knowledge of the targets of the different drugs, combined with molecular profiling of the tumors to treat, will allow a tailored pharmacogenomic approach.",0

Additional purposes included describing the preparation the parent provided to the child prior to the immunization and parents' plans for assistance following the immunization. The convenience sample included 41 parents (or grandparents) of 40 children between the ages of 18 months and 6 years who were receiving routine immunizations at two urban and five rural clinics in the Midwest. Parents were interviewed regarding plans to assist their child before and after immunization; actual parent-child interactions during immunizations were audiotaped. Data were analyzed descriptively; researchers worked in pairs to achieve 100% inter-rater agreement when coding observations into themes. The parents reported using nine psychological preparation strategies (i.e., procedural information, sensory information, relaxation training, telling the child why the procedure was necessary, and role play) to assist their children in the preparatory phase. Three strategies were used both during (procedural information, distraction, and physical contact) and after (physical contact, praise, and rewards) the immunization. Ten children received no preparation for the immunization; nine of these were younger than 3 years of age. The single most reported source of information to parents about helping their child with immunizations was their physician.",0
,Hereditary spastic paraplegias.,"We report a case of hereditary spastic paraplegia. This 38-year-old Chinese man has had lower limb weakness and spasticity for 10 years. He has normal cognition, no sensory deficits, ataxia or cataracts. There is a strong family history of spastic paraplegia. His paternal grandmother, great uncle, father, and elder brother all had weakness and spasticity. A genetic analysis showed that our patient was heterozygous for the mutation p.P361L in SPG4. He was diagnosed with spastic paraplegia type 4, autosomal dominant (SPG4, MIM#182601). About 40% of cases of hereditary spastic paraplegia are due to mutations in SPG4 encoding for spastin, while 10% are due to mutations in SPG3A encoding for atlastin. To date, 38 hereditary spastic paraplegia loci and 16 hereditary spastic paraplegia-related genes have been identified. Other features include sphincter disturbance and dorsal column disturbance. Our patient may be the first case of SPG4 confirmed by genetic analysis locally. We hope to raise clinicians' awareness of this disease and its possible molecular diagnosis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.020,A photochemical approach for controlled drug release in targeted drug delivery,"Photochemistry provides a unique mechanism that enables the active control of drug release in cancer-targeting drug delivery. This study investigates the light-mediated release of methotrexate, an anticancer drug, using a photocleavable linker strategy based on o-nitrobenzyl protection. We evaluated two types of the o-nitrobenzyl-linked methotrexate for the drug release study and further extended the study to a fifth-generation poly(amidoamine) dendrimer carrier covalently conjugated with methotrexate via the o-nitrobenzyl linker. We performed the drug release studies by using a combination of three standard analytical methods that include UV/vis spectrometry, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and anal. HPLC. This article reports that methotrexate is released by the photochemical mechanism in an actively controlled manner. The rate of the drug release varies in response to multiple control parameters, including linker design, light wavelength, exposure time, and the pH of the medium where the drug release occurs.",0

https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2052.2000.00628.x,Mapping quantitative trait loci for stress induced alterations in porcine leukocyte numbers and functions,"To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with effects on 'stress' induced alterations of porcine immune functions, a number of immune capacity traits were analysed in the F2 generation of a Wild Boar--Yorkshire intercross. All traits were measured prior, and one day after, exposure to experimental 'stress' (mixing and transport). The 'stress' protocol induced a decrease in numbers of circulating neutrophils and in spontaneous proliferation in vitro, whereas phagocytic capacity, mitogen induced proliferation and spontaneous IL-2 activity increased. The IFN-alpha production tended to decrease, although the individual variation was pronounced. More than 200 genetic markers have been scored in the entire pedigree and were used to trace the inheritance of individual chromosome segments. Wild Boar alleles were on average associated with higher mitogen induced IL-2 activity and a slightly lower decrease in IFN-alpha production after mixing and transport. Four QTLs with significant effects were identified; one influencing 'stress' induced alteration in numbers of neutrophils (chromosome 8), one influencing spontaneous proliferation after 'stress' (chromosome 2), one influencing mitogen induced IL-2 activity after 'stress' (chromosome 6) and one influencing 'stress' induced alterations in mitogen induced IL-2 activity (chromosome 12). In addition, several suggestive QTLs were indicated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0379-4172(06)60148-0,Inheritance Analysis of Herbicide-Resistant Transgenic Soybean Lines,"Four transgenic soybean lines generated via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were used to analyze inheritance of the transgenes. Seed chip GUS assay and herbicide leaf painting and spraying assays were applied to test the gus reporter gene and the herbicide resistant bar selectable marker gene, respectively. Three of the four transgenic soybean lines were stably inherited in a Mendelian fashion with co-segregation of both transgenes in a 3:1 segregation ratio in the T(1) progeny, indicating that both transgenes were integrated into the same locus of the soybean genome. Homozygous transgenic progeny plants were obtained in the T(2) generation of these lines, and the transgenes were inherited in five successive generations. However, in one transgenic line, all the T(1) progeny plants showed GUS negative and herbicide sensitive. Southern blotting analysis confirmed that the transgenes were passed into the T(1) progeny, indicating that the transgenes were both silenced. To test if the transgene silencing was due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) was inoculated on leaf tissues of the T(1) plants to test possible reverse effects on transgene silencing. Infection with SMV did not suppress transgene silencing, suggesting that transgene silencing in this transgenic line may not be due to post-transcriptional gene silencing.",0

The BA marker was present on 95% of bursal cells but only on 10% of splenic and blood B lymphocytes. The TA marker was expressed by 80% of thymus cells and weakly by 45% of splenic and 70% of blood T lymphocytes. The adopted immunological and genetic protocol offers a feasible approach towards detection of differentiation antigens in major histocompatibility complex-homozygous but 'minor' alloantigen-segregating populations.,0
https://doi.org/10.1517/14740331003774078,Vinorelbine for non-small cell lung cancer,"Vinorelbine is a 'third-generation' vinca alkaloid approved for the treatment of NSCLC. The introduction of 'third-generation' drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with substantially similar results among the different drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in this setting.This narrative review reports a synthesis of evidence available from published clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the activity and safety of vinorelbine, used as single agent or in combination chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, from 1990 to 2009.When vinorelbine was administered in a weekly schedule without interruptions, the most common toxicity was neutropenia that often precluded administration of the drug, therefore, reducing the dose intensity. A schedule providing administration of vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks seemed to improve the tolerability of the drug. Tolerability of the drug did not result lower in the elderly subset. None of the other 'third-generation' drugs were clearly better tolerated than vinorelbine. Moreover, in the adjuvant setting, vinorelbine is the only third-generation drug that demonstrated, in combination with cisplatin, a consistent improvement in survival on a long-term basis.Vinorelbine is an active and generally manageable therapeutic option for the treatment of both early and advanced NSCLC.",0
,[Hospital infections at an oncology hospital].,"During 23 months, the authors analyzed 8122 records of cancer patients admitted to the National Institute of Cancer of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The rate of hospital infection was of 18.4 infection episodes per 100 admissions. Hospital infections were detected in 556 patients (57.7%) of the surgical department. The overall rate of purulence seen in 4194 surgeries was 10.1%, and among 2153 clean surgeries, the authors found 95 (4.4%) suppurated surgeries. The surgical wound (28.2%), the respiratory tract (19.2%), and the urinary tract (18.7%) were the major sites involved during infections episodes. Of the 319 ICU patients evaluated, 154 acquired infection after the first 72 hours, with a mortality rate of 48.7%. The hospital microbial flora was made-up mostly of gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with a high incidence of micro-organisms that resist to major antibiotics of hospital use. The percentage of positive results in blood culture tests requested was of 23.7%, with a predominance of gram-negative bacteria (50.9%) and a high percentage of gentamicin-resistant micro-organisms. Antibiotics of greater use in surgical interventions were amikacin, first generation cephalosporins, and chloramphenicol, whereas amikacin, carbenicillin, and first and third generation cephalosporins prevailed in nonsurgical treatments. The authors' experience and findings re-emphasize the need and the importance of a broad multidisciplinary understanding and suggest the need of strict action for an effective control and prevention in hospitals of developing countries.",0
,The clinical problem of hepatitis transmission;.,"Although blood banks in this country have been testing every unit of blood for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg) by one of the highly sensitive ""third generation"" methods (radioimmunoassay or reversed passive hemagglutination) since September, 1975, post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) still remains the major hazard to patients who require transfusion with blood and blood products. Since there may be an interval of many months between transfusion and onset of PTH and many cases are subclinical, the best data on the incidence of PTH have come from prospective studies with careful follow-up of transfused patients. Such studies first established the validity of HBSAg as a marker for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and they have shown a dramatic reduction in the incidence of post-transfusion type B hepatitis following the elemination of HBSAg positive blood from transfusion. Nevertheless, PTH cases not associated with HBV or HAV, which are termed non-A, non-B hepatitis, continue to occur commonly among transfused patients. Non-A, non-B hepatitis appears to be subclinical in many instances, but it can produce prolonged persistence of abnormal liver function tests, which may be associated with chronic liver disease. The outstanding risk factor responsible for the development of PTH has been shown to be blood from paid donors in every study which has evaluated this factor. HBSAg and anti-HBS prevalences were found to be much higher in paid donor groups than in voluntary donors. Accordingly, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed that all units of blood be labeled to indicate whether they were collected from voluntary or paid donors in order to inform consumers of the relative hepatitis risks of blood units from these different donor populations. In addition to HBSAg testing and reduced use of blood from paid donors, measures which may provide future reduction of the hepatitis hazard associated with blood transfusion include avoidance of unnecessary transfusions, identification of the agent(s) responsible for non-A non-B hepatitis and development of tests for these agents, idenfification and avoidance of blood from donors implicated in PTH cases, development of methods for immunizing transfused patients against the various agents responsible for PTH, and use of frozen-washed red blood cells for transfusion. Efforts to develop and/or evaluate these various approaches are currently being actively pursued in many laboratories.",0

Hitherto, the test is carried out with field-collected animals. In order to provide a more standardized and continuously available test organism reproduction and growth experiments were performed for a period of one year in laboratory under simulated summer conditions (light/dark 16:8 at 15, 19, and 23 degrees C). C. volutator was the first time reproduced successfully in laboratory for several generations and independent from its natural life cycle also in winter. The females produced two to three broods with a mean number of 96 offspring. A mean growth rate of 0.07 mm per day was determined at 15 degrees C. The reproduction and growth experiments provide consequently the essential base for the development of a chronic toxicity test with C. volutator.",0
https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.8.3519,Initial frequency of alleles for resistance to <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> toxins in field populations of <i>Heliothis virescens</i>,"The risk of rapid pest adaptation to an insecticide is highly dependent on the initial frequency of resistance alleles in field populations. Because we have lacked empirical estimates of these frequencies, population-genetic models of resistance evolution have relied on a wide range of theoretical estimates. The recent commercialization of genetically engineered cotton that constitutively produces an insecticidal protein derived from the biocontrol agent, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has raised concern that we lack data needed to quantify the risk of insect pests such as Heliothis virescens rapidly adapting to this ecologically valuable class of toxins. By individually mating over 2,000 male H. virescens moths collected in four states to females of a Bt toxin-resistant laboratory strain, and screening F1 and F2 offspring for tolerance of the toxic protein, we were able to directly estimate the field frequency of alleles for resistance as 1.5 x 10(-3). This high initial frequency underscores the need for caution in deploying transgenic cotton to control insect pests. Our single-pair mating technique greatly increases the efficiency of detecting recessive resistance alleles. Because alleles that decrease target site sensitivity to Bt toxins and other insecticides are often recessive, this technique could be useful in estimating resistance allele frequencies in other insects exposed to transgenic insecticidal crops or conventional insecticides.",0

,[Sarcomatous degeneration of a familial cavernous angiomatosis (Bean's syndrome) (author's transl)].,"Although the classification of ""Ullman's universal angiomatosis"" has not yet been completely defined, the authors estimed it interesting to report an observation which may fall into this denomination. This observation concerns a generalized cavernous angiomatosis differing from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler type) with its conventional skin and mucous membrane manifestations and its visceral forms. The patient presented cutaneous and probably digestive generalized cavernomatosis related to blue rubber bleb naevus. In connection with this observation, the authors attempt to offer reasons in support of the distinctions which appear to exist between glomangiomatosis and glomangioma. This observation is also interesting from two other standpoints: 1. the striking lineal descent: in five generations, seven subjects presented identical angiomatoses; 2. the malignant transformation (angiosarcoma) of one of the cavernous elements.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2009.03.004,Evaluation of [11C]laniquidar as a tracer of P-glycoprotein: radiosynthesis and biodistribution in rats,"At present, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function can be studied using positron emission tomography (PET) together with a labelled P-gp substrate such as R-[11C]verapamil. Such a tracer is, however, less suitable for investigating P-gp (over)expression. Laniquidar is a third-generation P-gp inhibitor, which has been used in clinic trials for modulating multidrug resistance transporters. The purpose of the present study was to develop the radiosynthesis of [11C]laniquidar and to assess its suitability as a tracer of P-gp expression. The radiosynthesis of [11C]laniquidar was performed by methylation of the carboxylic acid precursor with [11C]CH3I. The product was purified by HPLC and reformulated over a tC18 Seppak, yielding a sterile solution of [11C]laniquidar in saline. For evaluating [11C]laniquidar, rats were injected with 20 MBq [11C]laniquidar via a tail vein and sacrificed at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after injection. Several tissues and distinct brain regions were dissected and counted for radioactivity. In addition, uptake of [11C]laniquidar in rats pretreated with cyclosporine A and valspodar (PSC 833) was determined at 30 min after injection. Finally, the metabolic profile of [11C]laniquidar in plasma was determined. [11C]Laniquidar could be synthesized in moderate yields with high specific activity. Uptake in brain was low, but significantly increased after administration of cyclosporine A. Valspodar did not have any effect on cerebral uptake of [11C]laniquidar. In vivo rate of metabolism was relatively low. Further kinetic studies are needed to investigate the antagonistic behaviour of [11C]laniquidar at tracer level.",0
,Population dynamics and schistosomal infection of Biomphalaria alexandrina in four irrigation canals in Egypt.,"The natural growth, reproductivity, mortality and schistosomal infection of Biomphalaria alexandrina, the snail vector of Schistosoma mansoni in Egypt, were studied for one year in four irrigation canals, namely El-Khassa and Radwan (Giza Governorate) and Sendebis and Sanafeer (Qalyoubiya Governorate). Radwan canal contains a considerably dense Biomphalaria population and three generations of snails (parents generation and autumn and spring generations) were recognized. Two phases of growth were distinguished in both autumn and spring generations, a faster phase followed by a slower one. The faster phase extends from January to May and from March to August in the autumn and spring generations, respectively. The daily mortality rate of snails was highest in the hot season (June--September) and lowest in the cold months (December--April). Continuous reproductivity of Biomphalaria snails was observed allover the year with highest values of reproduction index from November to March. Biomphalaria snails collected from El Khassa and Radwan canals were free of S. mansoni infection, while snails of Sanafeer canal carried patent infection in September and October. Prepatent infection was also found in Sanafeer canal in July and September and in Sendebis canal in September.",0

https://doi.org/10.3393/jksc.2010.26.4.246,Change in Expression of Survivin Caused by Using Oxaliplatin in HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells,"Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum compound, and it has no nephrotoxicity and has reduced bone marrow toxicity. Cancer cells that are resistant to cisplatin are sensitive to oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is used widely for the treatment of colon cancers. Recently, oxaliplatin was reported to inhibit the expression of survivin, which protects cell apoptosis. However, there are no reports on the expressions of survivin variants and the changes in intracellular localization of survivin in cancer cells. We studied the expression of survivin caused by oxaliplatin in HCT116 colon cancer cells, and we observed the localization of survivin in the mitotic phase.We treated the HCT116 colon cancer cells with 2.0 µM of oxaliplatin, and we studied the expressions of survivin protein, and survivin mRNA variants, as well as the changes in intracellular localization, by using the Western blot method, RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and flowcytometry.Oxaliplatin inhibits the expression of the survivin protein and survivin mRNA in HCT116 colon cancer cells. The expression of the survivin-2B variants, which have no antiapoptotic activity but control cell mitosis by localization on a microtubule, is reduced continuously 2 days after treatment with oxaliplatin. In immunocytochemistry, expression of survivin in the cytoplasm is reduced and especially is not expressed in microtubules and contractile rings.One of the mechanisms of oxaliplatin is to inhibit the expression of and to change the localization of survivin. Based on these results, we suggest that changes in the expression of survivin variants and in their localization are two effects of oxaliplatin.",0

Cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Cefmenoxime was the most active against Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00339.x,"THE INFLUENCE OF VARIABLE RATES OF INBREEDING ON FITNESS, ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIVENESS, AND EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL","We manipulated experimental populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.) under three inbreeding schemes (fast, slow, and punctuated) to partition out the influences of different means and variances in the rate of inbreeding, per generation, while controlling for the final level of inbreeding as a constant. One treatment used constant fast inbreeding (11% per generation; Ne = 4 for 4 generations), for a comparison to one that was consistently slow (3% per generation; Ne = 16 for 14 generations). The third followed a model for serial founder-flush events. Each founder-flush episode involved a one-generation pulse of fast inbreeding (Ne = 4) followed by two generations of very low (or no) inbreeding, yielding high intergenerational variation (i.e., for an average inbreeding rate of 4% per generation). Allozyme assays showed that we achieved the intended final inbreeding coefficient of about 37%. All inbreeding schemes decreased fitness levels in terms of egg-to-adult viability, development time, and male mating success relative to the outbred control. The consistently fast inbreeding protocol had more pronounced reductions in fitness, relative to the other two inbreeding schemes. In comparison to the fast and punctuated regimes, the consistently slow protocol preserved evolutionary potential (as assayed by the genetic divergence of subpopulations exposed to different environments) in egg-to-adult viability, and (albeit anecdotally) reduced the extinction probabilities, especially in a novel environment. The punctuated treatment did not optimize the potential for purge as predicted, but instead reduced fitness, evolutionary potential, and environmental responsiveness (as measured by genotype-by-environment interactions). This founder-flush treatment also had the highest extinction probabilities. Longer periods of population flush might be necessary to purge effectively in a punctuated scheme. We conclude that the rate of inbreeding, independent from the final level, can have important effects on population fitness, environmental responsiveness, and evolutionary potential.",0

This study explored Latino parents' perceptions of their ability to prevent obesity in children. Three focus groups were conducted with 26 Latino parents of preschoolers at a New York City Head Start program. Parents perceived high levels of ability to prevent obesity primarily via dietary influence. Four factors negatively impacted parents' ability: family history, intergenerational and interparental issues, adolescence, and societal pressures. Culturally effective, family-based obesity interventions among Latinos should build upon parental perceptions of ability to prevent obesity, while simultaneously helping parents address the factors they perceive challenge this ability.",0

It is very apparent that trying to reshape an ageing system to meet the demands of today's patients and their physicians is just not going to be effective or efficient. In the past educators cared little about the working conditions for trainees such as the living and learning environment, social support and compensation models. You were just fortunate to be ""chosen"". Surgical educators in the 21st Century must reexamine their roles and consider what message they are sending to future generations on these and other critical issues that impact on safe patient care.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.6.791,Body weight and egg weight dynamics in layers,"The association between body weight-age and egg weight-age patterns was studied in a segregating population of laying hens belonging to the F3 generation of a Rhode Island Red x White Leghorn reciprocal cross. Body weight and egg weight were expressed as a function of time using the model developed by Weatherup and Foster. Each hen was characterized in terms of its asymptotic body weight (ABW), maturing rate for body weight (MBW), asymptotic egg weight (AEW), and maturing rate for egg weight (MEW) values. Four groups of hens were distinguished by means of a principal component analysis. Birds belonging to Groups 1 and 3 were discriminated for their egg weight-age pattern. Group 1 included hens laying the heaviest eggs (AEW = 66.1 g) at the lowest maturing rate (MEW = 0.922), the inverse being true for birds in Group 3 (AEW = 55.7 g and MEW = 0.737). Birds belonging to Groups 2 and 4 were distinguished for their body weight-age pattern. Hens in Group 2 showed the lowest ABW (1,893 g) and MBW (0.764) whereas the heaviest (ABW = 2,802 g) and less mature (MBW = 0.929) birds were found in Group 4. The results confirm the partial pleiotropic basis of the body weight-egg weight correlation, evincing the feasibility of applying selective pressure not only on each character separately but also on maturing rate independently of asymptotic weight within each trait. This strategy could be implemented using a biological selection index based on principal component analysis equations.",0

A 7-month-old boy developed a prostatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Family history revealed that his maternal grandmother had died of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor at age 37 years and had been affected with neurofibromatosis. His mother (aged 36 years) has also developed a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and NF has been confirmed in both mother and son. This family illustrates a cluster of sarcomas associated with NF and shows the importance of thorough investigation of reported family illnesses.,0

This study aims to elucidate factors associated with exclusive breast-feeding in Japan and use this information to achieve child-rearing support worldwide by promoting breast-feeding.This cross-sectional study used data from a survey conducted by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the Japanese government, the First Longitudinal Survey of Babies in 21st Century. All subjects were infants (n=53,575) born in Japan in 2001 between January 10 and 17 and between July 10 and 17. According to the data, the exclusive breast-feeding rate in Japan during the first 6 months of life was 21.0%. We examined the factors associated with exclusive breast-feeding using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.Among the factors examined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for exclusive breast-feeding was low for late childbearing, low birth weight infants, multiple births, smoking parents, living with grandparents, and feeling burdened by childrearing. The adjusted OR was high for factors that included sufficient childcare leave and consultation about childrearing with the spouse, a birth attendant and/or nurse, and a peer in a child-rearing circle.Exclusive breast-feeding is associated not only with medical factors but also with social factors. This study clarifies the necessity of social support to reduce the child rearing burden and a political system to promote paternal participation in childrearing and to improve the childcare leave system.",0
,Congenital carpal tunnel syndrome: case report of autosomal dominant inheritance and review of the literature.,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is unusual in childhood, and familial occurrence has been reported infrequently. A case of CTS in a seven-year-old boy, associated with abnormal thickening of the transverse carpal ligament and aplasia of the median nerve distal to this ligament, is described. Clinical, electrodiagnostic, and surgical findings are presented: all were consistent with absence of the median nerve distal to the transverse carpal ligament. Family history of CTS was positive in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant transmission in three generations. Thickening of the transverse carpal ligament has been described, although infrequently, in childhood and familial CTS. Aplasia of the median nerve distally has not been reported in association with this anatomic abnormality. Case reports of familial CTS are reviewed, and other congenital anomalies which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CTS in children and adults are discussed.",0

Volunteers were randomly assigned to a HB or CTL condition. HB participants (n = 28) were asked to participate in lifestyle, aerobic, muscular strength, and flexibility activities at least 3 times per week and they completed 73% of the recommended PA bouts. CTL condition participants (n = 9) were asked to continue their usual pattern of physical activity. Changes in physical activity were measured pre-and post-intervention using the Physical Best questionnaire and pedometer step counts (3-day average). Changes in health-related fitness were assessed using Fitnessgram tests. Group x Time interactions were significant for changes in participation in flexibility activity (d/wk) and steps/day, indicating that the HB group experienced significant positive changes in the expected direction (+305% and +37%, respectively), while the CTL group regressed (-15% and -13%, respectively). The G x T interaction for mile time was significant, although not in the expected direction (CTL group < by 14% and HB group < by 5%). Findings should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations of the study, but several suggestions are made for more effectively studying this topic in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.3816/clc.2010.n.003,Oxaliplatin in First-line Therapy for Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Platinum doublets are the recommended standard first-line chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As efficacy outcomes associated with currently approved agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) are broadly similar, the decision about which platinum-based doublet to use is based on other factors such as toxicity. The goals for new platinum agents are to maintain and perhaps improve current efficacy and to improve toxicity. The aim of this article is to review the available clinical data from studies investigating the third-generation platinum analogue oxaliplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. Information was obtained from the PubMed database and from recent presentations at national and international meetings. Oxaliplatin has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with a wide range of other chemotherapies (vinca alkaloids, taxanes, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed), mainly in phase II trials. Preliminary results from studies in which oxaliplatin-based doublets have been combined with targeted agents (eg, bevacizumab) are now available. In general, the clinical activity observed with oxaliplatin-based therapy is similar to that seen with other currently used platinum regimens, although outcomes vary between individual trials (response rates, 23%-48%; median progression-free survival, 2.7-7.3 months; median overall survival, 7.3-13.7 months). The toxicity profile of oxaliplatin, particularly when compared with cisplatin, makes it an alternative treatment, especially in patients unable to tolerate cisplatin. However, well-conducted randomized phase III trials will be needed to clarify which particular groups of patients with NSCLC may benefit from oxaliplatin-based therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1006/expr.1996.0053,Leishmania amazonensis:Cultivation and Characterization of Axenic Amastigote-like Organisms,"Extracellular amastigote-like forms of Leishmania amazonensis can be maintained in axenic culture at 32 degrees C, pH 4.6, with a generation time of approximately 17 hr. This species of Leishmania is of particular interest since it has been associated with cutaneous, diffuse cutaneous, and mucocutaneous forms of the disease. Immunofluorescence, Western and Northern blot analyses, and immunoprecipitation have been used to estimate the expression levels of amastigote or promastigote antigens in axenically cultured amastigotes. In these analyses, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for either the amastigote (A-1, A-2, P-2, P-4, P-5, P-8) or promastigote (M-2, P-9, and F-4) and a DNA probe that was specific for the amastigote gene encoding the protein reactive with mAb P-4 have been employed. The amastigote-like organisms were infective for peritoneal and J774.G8 macrophages and BALB/c mice. While amastigote-like forms maintained at pH 4.6, 32 degrees C transformed to promastigotes when transferred to pH 7.3, 24 degrees C, transformation of promastigotes to amastigote-like organisms required a period of growth at pH 4.6 24 degrees C prior to transfer to 32 degrees C. This is the first report of the axenic cultivation of L. amazonensis amastigote-like organisms. This species grows in continual culture at a lower pH than any other species characterized to date. These organisms will prove useful in further studies of the biochemistry, immunology, developmental biology, and molecular biology of this parasite.",0
,[Spontaneous infection of ascitic fluid due to Salmonella typhimurium in a cirrhotic patient undergoing selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin].,"Spontaneous infection of ascitic fluid with Salmonella typhimurium is very rare and exhibits uncommon features.A Child-Pugh C cirrhotic 47 year-old woman was hospitalised for fever and coma. Norfloxacin 400 mg per day had been introduced three months earlier as secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed, and an intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started (cefotaxime 1 g/8h). Bacteriologic samples isolated Salmonella typhimurium in ascites, blood and stools; Escherichia coli sensitive to norfloxacin in blood and Escherichia coli resistant to norfloxacin but sensitive to cefotaxime in urine. Despite the initial regression of the hepatic encephalopathy and the decrease in fever, the patient died twenty days after admission to hospital.This observation is exceptional because of the simultaneous presence of Salmonella typhimurium in ascites, blood and stools. It underlines the features of spontaneous Salmonella bacterial peritonitis: rare, occurring in immuno-suppressive diseases, virulent despite sensitivity to third generation cephalosporines and of often poor prognosis. Compliance to norfloxacin prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients is a real problem, since in the case of poor compliance such patients are exposed both to sensitive norfloxacin bacteria, and to resistant norfloxacin bacteria selected by the norfloxacin prophylaxis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.02.003,Maternal inexperience as a risk factor of innate fear and PTSD-like symptoms in mice,"In laboratory rats and mice, differences in maternal care during the first week of life have been shown to exert long-lasting consequences on cognitive functioning and stress processing of the offspring. Such epigenetic programming is also assumed to play an important role in the transgenerational transmission of PTSD in humans. Here we studied whether even subtle within-subject differences in maternal care - caused by increasing mothering experience from the first to the second litter - can determine subsequent vulnerability for PTSD-like behaviour. To assess the influence of maternal experience on different components of fear, we analysed the adult male offspring of two subsequent litters (offspring 1, 2) from the same parental C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) and C57BL/6JOla (B6JOla) mice for (i) their innate anxiety behaviour on a modified hole board and (ii) their vulnerability to develop long-lasting PTSD-like fear symptoms (""hyperarousal"", contextually conditioned fear) following perception of an inescapable foot shock. Increasing maternal experience reduced the animals' innate fear on the modified hole board (more exploration, less inhibition), the acute stress reaction to the shock and - one month after trauma - the levels of hyperarousal-like behaviour in the PTSD-prone B6N strain. In contrast, both acquisition and extinction of contextually conditioned fear were increased in the second offspring, representing cognitive flexibility. A factor analysis showed that innate fear, ""hyperarousal"" and conditioned fear represent independent behavioural dimensions. In conclusion, the present study identifies maternal inexperience as a risk factor for the development of PTSD-like symptoms. This effect - occurring in inbred mice on an almost identical genetic background - emphasizes the impact of epigenetic factors in PTSD-like behaviour.",1

However, anti-HCV seroconversion was uncommon in a recent study of patients with post-transfusional hepatitis in Paris, France (N. Asar et al., companion paper). The aim of the present study was to detect viral markers, in particular HCV RNA and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, in these patients. A combination of second-generation assays for anti-HCV antibodies and the polymerase chain reaction were used to identify HCV RNA and HBV DNA sequences in serum samples collected before and after transfusion from patients who developed non-A, non-B hepatitis. Eighteen cases of acute, post-transfusional, non-A, non-B hepatitis were identified in the prospective clinical survey. Only three of these 18 subjects developed anti-HCV antibodies in second-generation tests. HCV RNA was identified in the serum of these three subjects but in none of the others. Two patients who were anti-HCV-negative had polymerase chain reaction evidence of HBV DNA. Known viral markers were not identified in 13 of the 18 patients with acute post-transfusional non-A, non-B hepatitis. These results raise the issue of HCV strains or 'non-A, non-B, non-C' viruses not identified by current HCV and HBV markers and implicated in post-transfusional hepatitis in France.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/02652030903207243,Management of fumonisin contamination in maize kernels through the timing of insecticide application against the European corn borerOstrinia nubilalisHübner,"The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, is the principal pest of maize in Central and South Europe. It is known to promote Fusarium verticillioides infection in maize grain, a recognized producer of fumonisins. Field experiments were performed in 2006 and 2007 in two sites in NW Italy to determine the effects of the timing of insecticide application on ECB damage, fungal ear rot and fumonisin contamination under natural conditions. Different insecticide application timings were compared, from maize flowering to approximately 15 days after the flight peak of adult ECB. At harvest, the ears were rated for incidence and severity of ECB damage, fungal ear rot symptoms and fumonisin (FB(1) + FB(2)) contamination. In all years/sites, treatments applied at the beginning of consistent ECB flight activity were most effective in controlling insect damage on ears. Fungal ear rot and fumonisin contamination were significantly affected by ECB control. The efficacy of the best timing of insecticide application in controlling fumonisin contamination was, on average, 93% compared to the untreated control. Contamination levels of these mycotoxins increased with either an earlier or later treatment. Furthermore, an earlier insecticide application showed lower fumonisin contamination than a treatment applied after the adult flight peak. Production of maize kernels and maize-based foods that do not exceed the maximum international and EU permitted levels for fumonisins could be enhanced by appropriate insecticide treatment against second generation ECB. The optimum time for insecticide application is between the beginning of consistent adult flight activity and the flight peak.",0

Adapted Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue interviews were conducted with 70 outpatients in a Paris suburb. Among them, 42 were either first- or second-generation immigrants, most from North Africa. Explanatory models were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively according to migration status, assessing potential confounders with multivariate linear models. Explanatory models were heterogeneous. Compared with nonmigrants, migrants reported fewer somatic and violence-related symptoms. They attributed the causes of their addiction more frequently to social and magico-religious factors and less to psychological factors. Conversely, no difference in addiction severity was found between migrants and nonmigrants. Considering local patterns of illness experience and meaning of drug dependence is a critical component of culturally sensitive clinical care.",1
https://doi.org/10.1677/jme-06-0015,Rat strain-dependent susceptibility to ischemia-induced retinopathy associated with retinal vascular endothelial growth factor regulation,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inflammation, vascular permeability, and angiogenic factor. Variations of the VEGF gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Previous studies have shown that Brown Norway (BN) rats have higher retinal VEGF levels and more severe retinal vascular leakage than Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats in response to ischemia and diabetes. To investigate the molecular mechanism of vascular leakage in this animal model, F2 progeny were generated by crossbreeding BN and SD rats. Neonatal rats were exposed to hyperoxia to induce oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models. The F2 rats in response to ischemia have shown a linear distribution of retinal VEGF levels, which is significantly and positively correlated to retinal vascular leakage. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at upstream stimulating factor-binding site in the VEGF promoter region between BN and SD rats. No differences were found in retinal vascular permeability or VEGF levels between F2 rats with BN, SD, and BN/SD alleles of VEGF SNP. The increased retinal VEGF levels are correlated to ischemia-induced retinal vascular leakage in the OIR rat model. The VEGF mRNA and promoter are not responsible for increased retinal VEGF level and vascular permeability. The up-regulation of VEGF expression activated by a yet to be identified upstream factor or mediator affecting VEGF stability may be associated with a high susceptibility to retinal vascular leakage in BN rats.",0
https://doi.org/10.1353/pbm.2005.0066,Why Birdsong Is Sometimes Like Music,"The sounds and songs of birds have inspired the musical compositions of numerous cultures throughout the globe. This article examines a variety of compositions from Western music that feature birdsong and explores the concept of birds as both vocalists and instrumentalists. The concept of birds as composers is then developed-how they use rhythmic variations, pitch relationships, and combinations of notes similar to those found in music-and the theory that birds create variation in their songs partially to avoid monotony is considered. Various families of birds that borrow sounds from other species are surveyed, in particular the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), which may have inspired a Mozart composition. We conclude that the fusion of avian bioacoustics and the study of birdsong in music may function as a conservation tool, raising the awareness of humans and stimulating future generations to save for posterity what remains of the natural world.",0

The mean patient age (SD) was 40.48 (11.53) years. The kidneys were horseshoe in 49 (24.7%), malrotated in 120 (60.6%), and duplex in 29 (14.7%). All patients were treated on an outpatient basis using two second-generation lithotripters (Dornier MFL 5000 and Toshiba Echolith). Pretreatment auxiliary measures were required in 6 patients (3%). Follow-up data were recorded at 3 months. The statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, with differences considered statistically significant if P <0.05.The mean stone length (SD) was 13.54 (5.49) mm. The stones were single in 148 (74.7%), of new onset in 155 (78.3%), and on the right side in 82 (41.4%). All stones, but 5 (2.5%), were radiopaque. The overall stone-free rate was 72.2%. Neither the type of renal anomaly nor the type of lithotripter had any impact on the stone-free rate (P >0.05). Stone burden (length and number) had a significant influence on the stone-free rate (P <0.05). No extraordinary complications were recorded. Steinstrasse developed in 7 patients (3.5%). No deterioration of renal function or configuration was detected.ESWL is safe and reliable for treatment of urolithiasis in anomalous kidneys. It should be the primary therapy when the stones are less than 20 mm. The ESWL outcome is comparable for normal and anomalous kidneys when the calculus size is considered.",0

We performed stratified analyses on an Illinois transgenerational dataset of Mexican–American infants (1989–1991) and their mothers (1956–1976) with appended U.S. census income information. In Cook County, Illinois established (second or higher generation) US-born Mexican–American women (N = 2,006) had a low birth weight (<2,500 g) rate of 6.2% compared to 4.8% for first generation US-born Mexican–American women (N = 1,450), RR = 1.3 (1.0–1.6). In both subgroups, low birth weight, preterm, and intrauterine growth retarded components rates did not increase with advancing maternal age. First generation 30–35 year old US-born Mexican–American women (N = 159) had a low birth weight rate of 3.1% compared to 4.2% for their teen counterparts (N = 386), RR = 0.8 (0.3–2.0). Established 30–35 year old US-born Mexican–American women (N = 330) had a low birth weight rate of 4.9% compared to 7.4% for their teen counterparts (N = 459), RR = 0.7 (0.4–1.2). There was no evidence of weathering among US-born Mexican–American mothers with a lifelong residence in lower income neighborhoods, with a general downward trend in low birth weight rates with increasing age until age 30–35. Rates of low birth weight, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth retardation do not increase with advancing age among first generation and established US-born 15–35 year old Mexican–American women. This trend persists among both generations of women with a lifelong residence in lower income neighborhoods.",0

The first generation antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, promethazine and hydroxyzine) are still widely available and in use today. These drugs have considerable sedative effects caused by their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The next generation of antihistamines to emerge in the market were devoid of these sedative effects; however, two (terfenadine and astemizole) have shown rare but lethal cardiotoxic side effects. The third generation antihistamines, metabolites of the earlier drugs, have demonstrated no cardiac effects of the parent drugs and are at least as potent. Many have exhibited superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, including an improved onset of action and duration of effect.

In the dominant-lethal test 25 to 60% dominant-lethal mutations were obtained depending on the mating intervals. In the heritable translocation test 11% sterile and partially sterile F 1 males were observed in 250 offspring of the MMS group. All of the 14 partially sterile and 6 of the 14 sterile F 1 males were demonstrated to be translocation carriers. Fertility of the partial steriles was about 40% of normal fertility. The translocation frequencies in the primary spermatocytes of the partially sterile F 1 males varied between 2 and 99%. Transmission of partially sterility and translocations was confirmed in the F 2 generation. There were no partially sterile or sterile males among the 245 controls.,0

Data were gathered when children were 4 to 5 years of age. Twenty-six percent of the children lived in 3-generation households, 39% had a history of maltreatment, and 32% of the mothers had depression scores in the clinical range.Child behavioral problems were measured with the Child Behavior Checklist, completed by the mother, and child developmental status was assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test, administered by research assistants.Multiple regression analyses revealed that children who had been reported for maltreatment and had mothers with depressive symptoms had more externalizing behavior problems, compared with children who experienced neither risk or only 1 risk. However, when residential status was considered, children with the greatest number of externalizing behavior problems were those who experienced both maltreatment and maternal depressive symptoms and lived in 3-generation households. Children who had been reported for maltreatment or had mothers with depressive symptoms were more likely to have internalizing problems, compared with children with neither risk. Residential status was not related to children's internalizing behavior problems or cognitive development.Living in a 3-generation household did not protect preschool children from the behavior problems associated with maltreatment and depression. In contrast, living in a 3-generation household was associated with more behavior problems among the highest risk group of children--those who had been maltreated and had mothers with symptoms of depression. Although 3-generation families may provide an important source of support and stability for adolescent mothers and their infants early in the parenting process, it may not be advisable to rely on 3-generation households as young mothers enter adulthood, particularly among those with a history of maltreatment or depression. Children with the fewest number of behavior problems were living with their mothers in their own household (often with the father), had not been maltreated, and had mothers with few symptoms of depression.",1
https://doi.org/10.1155/2008/367590,Effects of Nebivolol on Endothelial Gene Expression during Oxidative Stress in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells,"The endothelium plays a key role in the development of atherogenesis and its inflammatory and proliferative status influences the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two beta blockers such as nebivolol and atenolol on gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) following an oxidant stimulus. HUVECs were incubated with nebivolol or atenolol (10 micromol/L) for 24 hours and oxidative stress was induced by the addition of oxidized (ox)-LDL. Ox-LDL upregulated adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, E-selectin, and P-selectin); proteins linked to inflammation (IL-6 and TNFalpha), thrombotic state (tissue factor, PAI-1 and uPA), hypertension such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), and vascular remodeling such as metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) and protease inhibitor (TIMP-1). The exposure of HUVECs to nebivolol, but not to atenolol, reduced these genes upregulated by oxidative stress both in terms of protein and RNA expression. The known antioxidant properties of the third generation beta blocker nebivolol seem to account to the observed differences seen when compared to atenolol and support the specific potential protective role of this beta blocker on the expression of a number of genes involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.",0

Changes were found in each progeny as follows : in PI - reduced erythrocyte count, increased reticulocytes (group II); enhanced ATP activity in brain homogenates (group II), as will as increased disulphide groups in homogenates from brain, liver and testis (group II), highly reduced indices of fertility - 50% and of gestation - 62% (group II), in 100% level of the same indices in the control animals respectively. In P2 - reticulocytosis, reduced CytO in homogenates of liver, reduced activity of ATP and SucDH, enhanced activity of LDH and G6PDH in brain homogenates (group I), reduced fertility index - 67% versus 100% of the controls. In P3 - increased erythrocyte count (group II), changes in the electrophoretic protein profile of serum (group II); reduction of ChEA (groups I and II) and CytO (group II) in liver, reduced ChEA in brain (group II). The results obtained suggest an eventual high real and potential risk for the human generation, when the males are exposed to considerable concentrations (doses) of lead under working conditions.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.11.003,Towards a unifying theory of late stochastic effects of ionizing radiation,"The traditionally accepted biological basis for the late stochastic effects of ionizing radiation (cancer and hereditary disease), i.e. target theory, has so far been unable to accommodate the more recent findings of non-cancer disease and the so-called non-targeted effects, genomic instability and bystander effect, thus creating uncertainty in radiation risk estimation. We propose that ionizing radiation can give rise to these effects through two distinct and independent routes, one essentially genetic, termed here type A, and the other essentially epigenetic, termed type B. Type B processes entail envisaging phenotype as represented by a dynamic attractor and radiation acting as an agent that stresses cellular processes leading to the adoption of a variant attractor/phenotype. Evidence from the literature indicates that type B processes can lead to the inheritance of variant cell attractors and mediate a category of trans-generational effects quite distinct from classical Mendelian inherited disease, which is type A. The causal relationships for radiation-induced somatic human health detriment, i.e., cancer and non-cancer (e.g., cardiovascular) disease, are discussed from the point of view of the proposed classification. This approach unifies at a fundamental level the heritable and late somatic effects of radiation into a single causal framework that has the potential to be extended to the effects of the other environmental agents damaging to health.",1

However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug. Solanezumab, another humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, was shown to neutralize soluble Aβ oligomers, which is believed to be the more neurotoxic Aβ species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting Aβ may not be clinically efficacious in AD. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab and two Phase III trials on solanezumab will tell us if passive anti-Aβ immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease, and if Aβ is still a viable target for anti-AD drugs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.004,The anti-leukemic efficacy of the third generation bisphosphonate ONO5920/YM529,"Ras proteins are frequently over-expressed in leukemia and contribute to leukemogenesis. We evaluated the anti-leukemic efficacy of a new third-generation bisphosphonate, ONO5920/YM529 (YM529). YM529 prevents the prenylation of Ras proteins and inhibited the growth of leukemic cells including a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expressing cell line in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, YM529 synergistically augmented the anti-leukemic activities of paclitaxel and daunorubicin in vitro. Importantly, YM529 prolonged the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human primary leukemic cells. These findings indicate that the YM529 may become a novel molecular therapeutic class for treatment of leukemias.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0145-2134(03)00038-3,La transmission de la violence sexuelle: description du phénomène et pistes de compréhension,"The aim of this article is to review what is currently understood about intergenerational transmission of child sexual abuse (CSA).CSA transmission is discussed first from the point of view of men CSA survivors who become sexually abusive, and then from the perspective of mothers who survived CSA whose children have been sexually abused. Mechanisms that may help us understand how CSA is transmitted from one generation to another are described. More specifically, focus is given to those mechanisms that might differentiate CSA survivors who break the cycle of abuse from those who perpetuate it.In light of the research reviewed, it seems that the transmission of CSA is far from inevitable, since one-third of sexually abusive men and half of sexually abused children's mothers mentioned having been sexually abused in their childhood. Because of the retrospective method used in many studies, causal links could not be established. However, some mechanisms have been proposed in order to better understand the phenomenon of CSA. Severity of abuse, attachment relationships with parental figures, as well as dissociative symptoms that follow the abuse were identified. Dissociative symptomatology appeared to be a determining factor in understanding the cycle of CSA.More studies on CSA transmission are needed to understand the mechanisms that are involved in that cycle, as well as to develop effective strategies to treat and prevent CSA.",0
https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.19.4.733,Strategies of medical treatment for metastatic breast cancer (Review),"Presently, metastatic breast cancer cannot be cured and therefore good palliation of symptoms and longer overall survival make the most important targets, always considering quality of life. In addition to the established hormonal therapies or chemotherapy regimens, several recent advances have accelerated progress in metastatic breast cancer treatment. As demonstrated in recent studies, the third-generation aromatase inhibitors are playing a significant role in the improvement of the therapeutic approach. The development of new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as taxanes, used alone in innovative schedules or in association with other drugs (mainly the anthracyclines), vinorelbine and gemcitabine, or capecitabine, which is administered orally, has broadened the scope of metastatic breast cancer chemotherapy. A new investigation field is represented by high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support, which has provided controversial preliminary results but is also acknowledged to deserve larger and randomized trials. Finally, the emergence of biological therapies such as the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab opens new and exciting prospects for the treatment of this disease. Moreover, the present trend is to try to rationalize the therapeutic approach on the basis of biological parameters which are prognostic and predictive of treatment response.",0
https://doi.org/10.1507/endocrj.50.91,A Family of Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia with an Activating Mutation of Calcium-Sensing Receptor Gene.,"Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) caused by activating mutations of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is characterized by hypocalcemia with inappropriately low concentration of PTH and relative hypercalciuria. Active vitamin D treatment often leads to nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in patients with ADH. However, differential diagnosis between ADH and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is sometimes very difficult. Here, we report a mutation of CaSR and its functional property found in three generations of a Japanese family. The proband developed seizures at 7 days of age. His mother and elder sister were discovered to have hypoparathyroidism by family survey, but his father was normocalcemic. His grandfather developed heart failure and was found to have hypoparathyroidism. All affected members had been treated with active vitamin D3 and bilateral nephrolithiasis were detected in three of them. DNA sequencing revealed that all affected patients had a heterozygous mutation in CaSR gene that causes proline to leucine substitution at codon 221 (P221L). In vitro functional analysis of the mutant CaSR by measuring inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in response to changes of extracellular Ca indicated that this mutation is an activating one and responsible for ADH in this family. Therefore, careful monitoring of urinary Ca excretion before and during treatment of PTH-deficient hypoparathyroidism is very important, and screening of CaSR mutation should be considered in patients with relative hypercalciuria or with a family history of hypocalcemia.",0

We observed that a red fluorescent transgenic malaria parasite of rodents, Plasmodium berghei-RedStar, is suitable for in vitro live imaging experiments but bleaches rapidly upon illumination in intravital imaging experiments using mice. We have therefore generated two additional transgenic parasite lines expressing the novel red fluorescent proteins tdTomato and mCherry, which have been reported to be much more photostable than first- and second-generation red fluorescent proteins including RedStar. We have compared all three red fluorescent parasite lines for their use in in vitro live and intravital imaging of P. berghei blood and liver parasite stages, using both confocal and wide-field microscopy. While tdTomato bleached almost as rapidly as RedStar, mCherry showed improved photostability and was bright in all experiments performed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1570-0232(02)00346-x,Estrogen receptor expression in the prostate of rats treated with dietary genistein,"Steroid hormones and their receptors play critical roles in the growth, development, and maintenance of the male reproductive tract. Genistein, a naturally occurring isoflavonoid primarily found in soybeans, interacts with estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER alpha and beta), with preferential affinity for ER beta. This is one mechanism whereby genistein may affect growth and development and potentially alter susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Previous studies have indicated effects of soy and/or genistein in the male rodent reproductive tract under certain exposure conditions. The current study was undertaken to determine if modulation of the expression of ER alpha and ER beta by dietary genistein may contribute to those effects. Rats in a two-generation study were fed 0, 5, 100, or 500 ppm genistein prior to mating and through pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, male pups were selected in each of the F(1) and F(2) generations and half of the pups continued on the same diet as their dams (G/G, continuous exposure) while their litter mates were placed on control chow (G/C, gestational and lactational exposure) until sacrifice on PND 140. Male reproductive organ weights, serum levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and ER alpha and ER beta protein levels in the ventral and dorsolateral prostate were the endpoints measured. Prostate sections were also evaluated microscopically. Statistically significant elevations in testosterone and DHT were observed in PND 140 animals from the F(1) generation, but they were not accompanied by organ weight changes. Body weight in the continuously dosed 500 ppm F(1) PND 140 animals was depressed relative to control, but organ weights in animals of either generation showed few treatment-related effects. While estrogen receptor levels were quite variable, levels of ER beta in the dorsolateral prostate were significantly depressed in all dose groups in the G/C exposure and the high dose group of the G/G exposure in F(1) rats, but not in F(2) rats. Given the growing body of knowledge on the significance of ER beta in the prostate, the evidence for apparent down regulation of this receptor by genistein may have implications for reproductive toxicity and carcinogenesis that warrant further investigation.",1
https://doi.org/10.1080/10473289.2003.10466324,An Environmental Decision-Making Tool for Evaluating Ground-Level Ozone-Related Health Effects,"A computer model called the Ozone Risk Assessment Model (ORAM) was developed to evaluate the health effects caused by ground-level ozone (O3) exposure. ORAM was coupled with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Third-Generation Community Multiscale Air Quality model (Models-3/CMAQ), the state-of-the-art air quality model that predicts O3 concentration and allows the examination of various scenarios in which emission rates of O3 precursors (basically, oxides of nitrogen [NOx] and volatile organic compounds) are varied. The principal analyses in ORAM are exposure model performance evaluation, health-effects calculations (expected number of respiratory hospital admissions), economic valuation, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis through a Monte Carlo simulation. As a demonstration of the system, ORAM was applied to the eastern Tennessee region, and the entire O3 season was simulated for a base case (typical emissions) and three different emission scenarios. The results indicated that a synergism occurs when reductions in NOx emissions from mobile and point sources were applied simultaneously. A 12.9% reduction in asthma hospital admissions is expected when both mobile and point source NOx emissions are reduced (50 and 70%, respectively) versus a 5.8% reduction caused by mobile source and a 3.5% reduction caused by point sources when these emission sources are reduced individually.",0

The average time for total development was 41.9 days (range = 35.1-49.6) at 25 degrees C and 89-95% of relative humidity. The mean number of eggs laid was lower in laboratory bred females either in pots (13.2 eggs/female) or vials (29.9 eggs/female) than in wild caught females (33.4 eggs/female). Immature mortality, mainly due to fungal and mite contamination, was higher during the first two instars than in the remaining immature stages. Adults were robust and healthy although difficult to feed on hamster or chick skin membrane. In summary, Lu. evansi is a colonizable species but requires specific conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.07.005,The trans-generational phase accumulation in the desert locust: Morphometric changes and extra molting,"To understand the underlying trans-generational phase accumulation, a classical morphometric characteristic, the F/C ratio (F, hind femur length; C, maximum head width), of adult desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) was monitored over eight consecutive generations. Adult F/C ratios, which are larger in solitarious locusts than in gregarious ones, were negatively correlated to the darkness of body color at hatching. Two successive generations were required for a complete shift from the gregarious (crowd-reared) to the solitarious (isolated-reared) phase and vice versa in the laboratory. That is (1) female adults needed to be exposed to crowded (or isolated) conditions so that their hatchlings would become large (or small) and dark (or green) in color, and (2) the hatchlings then needed to be exposed to crowded (or isolated) conditions for their entire nymphal stage. Solitarious locusts exhibited extra molting that influenced the F/C ratio in the adult stage, but did not exert significant influences on the trans-generational changes in this trait because the incidence was low. The incidence of extra molting was negatively correlated with nymphal survival rates. The morphometric trans-generational changes may be explained without assuming any accumulating internal factor.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.4960291304,Clinical utility of contrast-enhanced echocardiography,"Over the past three decades, echocardiography has become a major diagnostic tool in the arsenal of clinical cardiology for real-time imaging of cardiac dynamics. More and more, cardiologists' decisions are based on images created from ultrasound wave reflections. From the time ultrasound imaging technology provided the first insight into a human heart, our diagnostic capabilities have increased exponentially as a result of our growing knowledge and developing technologies. One of the most intriguing developments that brought about a decade-long combination of expectations and disappointments was the introduction of echocardiographic contrast agents. Despite repeated waves of controversy regarding the readiness of this technology for clinical use, it has overcome multiple hurdles and currently provides useful clinical information that helps cardiologists to diagnose heart disease accurately. Since the initial reports on the use of ultrasound contrast media such as agitated saline or renografin, the major advances in the field of contrast echocardiography have included (1) the development of stable perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles, frequently referred to as second-generation contrast agents; and (2) the development of contrast-targeted nonlinear imaging modes, such as harmonic imaging, pulse inversion, and power modulation, which allow consistent real-time visualization of these agents. These contrast agents in conjunction with the new imaging technology constitute powerful tools that improve our ability to evaluate left ventricular function and myocardial perfusion, and allow differential diagnosis of thrombi and intravascular masses. In this manuscript, we briefly review some of the literature that has provided the scientific basis for the use of echocardiographic contrast agents in the context of these important variables.",0
,[Hepatitis C and chronic alcoholic hepatopathy].,"We evaluated hepatitis C virus prevalence in 105 patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease by research of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by second generation recombinant based enzyme immunosorbent to assay and immunoblot to assay. 46 patients of 105 (43.7%) were anti-HCV positive: 2 in steatosis group (9.5%), 3 in steatofibrosis (23%), 10 in chronic active hepatitis (66.6%), 22 in cirrhosis (59.4%) and 9 in hepatocellular carcinoma (47.3%). These patients had higher levels of serum gammaglobulin and transaminases than seronegative patients. We think that there is a correlation between high prevalence of antibodies anti-HCV and the evolution of damage in chronic alcoholic liver disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.111.127555,The Relation Between Reproductive Value and Genetic Contribution,"Abstract What determines the genetic contribution that an individual makes to future generations? With biparental reproduction, each individual leaves a “pedigree” of descendants, determined by the biparental relationships in the population. The pedigree of an individual constrains the lines of descent of each of its genes. An individual’s reproductive value is the expected number of copies of each of its genes that is passed on to distant generations conditional on its pedigree. For the simplest model of biparental reproduction (analogous to the Wright–Fisher model), an individual’s reproductive value is determined within ∼10 generations, independent of population size. Partial selfing and subdivision do not greatly slow this convergence. Our central result is that the probability that a gene will survive is proportional to the reproductive value of the individual that carries it and that, conditional on survival, after a few tens of generations, the distribution of the number of surviving copies is the same for all individuals, whatever their reproductive value. These results can be generalized to the joint distribution of surviving blocks of the ancestral genome. Selection on unlinked loci in the genetic background may greatly increase the variance in reproductive value, but the above results nevertheless still hold. The almost linear relationship between survival probability and reproductive value also holds for weakly favored alleles. Thus, the influence of the complex pedigree of descendants on an individual’s genetic contribution to the population can be summarized through a single number: its reproductive value.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-4835(89)80002-8,Calcium antagonist-induced relaxation of the prostaglandin-F2α response of isolated calf retinal resistance arteries,"The relaxing effect of nitrendipine and D600 on isolated ring segments of calf retinal resistance arteries (i.d. ca. 200 microns) contracted with prostaglandin-F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) or high potassium solution was studied. The vessel response to both PGF2 alpha and potassium stimulation was dependent on extracellular calcium. Removal of extracellular calcium reduced the vessel response to PGF2 alpha and potassium by 85% and 98%, respectively (P less than 0.01). Both calcium antagonists induced a concentration dependent relaxation of PGF2 alpha pre-contracted vessels with = -log[IC50(M)]-values of 8.01 and 7.13 for nitrendipine and D600 (P less than 0.05), respectively. The calcium antagonists were equieffective in relaxing the vessels amounting to 33% for nitrendipine at 10(-6) M and 37% for D600 at 10(-5) M. Further analysis of the data revealed that the nitrendipine induced relaxation of the PGF2 alpha response was linearly correlated with the internal lumen diameter of the vessels. No correlation was found for the D600 induced relaxation. At the highest concentrations of nitrendipine, 10(-6) M, and D600, 10(-5) M, the potassium induced response was reduced by 94 and 75%, respectively. The results show that calcium antagonists only partially relax retinal resistance arteries contracted with PGF2 alpha although the vessels are dependent on extracellular calcium for active force generation. Calcium must therefore be activated by PGF2 alpha through other pathways than those blocked by calcium antagonists.",0
https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.17.014029,Mapping total suspended matter from geostationary satellites: a feasibility study with SEVIRI in the Southern North Sea,"Geostationary ocean colour sensors have not yet been launched into space, but are under consideration by a number of space agencies. This study provides a proof of concept for mapping of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid coastal waters from geostationary platforms with the existing SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) meteorological sensor on the METEOSAT Second Generation platform. Data are available in near real time every 15 minutes. SEVIRI lacks sufficient bands for chlorophyll remote sensing but its spectral resolution is sufficient for quantification of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid waters, using a single broad red band, combined with a suitable near infrared band. A test data set for mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea was obtained covering 35 consecutive days from June 28 until July 31 2006. Atmospheric correction of SEVIRI images includes corrections for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering, absorption by atmospheric gases and atmospheric transmittances. The aerosol correction uses assumptions on the ratio of marine reflectances and aerosol reflectances in the red and near-infrared bands. A single band TSM retrieval algorithm, calibrated by non-linear regression of seaborne measurements of TSM and marine reflectance was applied. The effect of the above assumptions on the uncertainty of the marine reflectance and TSM products was analysed. Results show that (1) mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea is feasible with SEVIRI for turbid waters, though with considerable uncertainties in clearer waters, (2) TSM maps are well correlated with TSM maps obtained from MODIS AQUA and (3) during cloud-free days, high frequency dynamics of TSM are detected.",0

Perversions of motherhood exist, although they are largely denied by a society which idealises being a mother. This denial may be caused by society's inability to see a woman as a complete human being. The aetiology of perversions in women is both psychobiological and social and it is bound up with the politics of power. Perverse motherhood can be seen as the product of the emotional instability and inadequate individuation brought about by a process involving at least three generations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/jbt.20386,Trans fat diet causes decreased brood size and shortened lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans delta-6-desaturase mutant fat-3,"Trans-fatty acids (TFAs) enter the diet through industrial processes and can cause adverse human health effects. The present study was aimed to examine the effects of dietary cis- and trans-fatty acids on the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Cis- or trans-18:1n9 triglycerides (25 μM) caused no apparent changes in the numbers of viable progeny of wild-type N2 animals. However, in fat-3 mutants lacking delta-6-desaturase, the trans-isomer caused modest decreases in lifespan and progeny after three generations. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) profiles were significantly altered in fat-3 mutants compared to wild type but were not altered after exposure to dietary cis- or trans-18:1n9. Genome-wide expression analysis of fat-3 mutants revealed hundreds of changes. Several genes involved in fat metabolism (acs-2, fat-7, mdt-15) were significantly increased by cis- or trans-18:1n9 without discrimination between isomers. These results provide support for the hypothesis that dietary trans fats are detrimental to development and aging.",1
,Trends in ipecac use: a survey of poison center staff.,"The steady decline in syrup of ipecac used by poisoned victims from a peak of 15% in 1985 to 2.3% in 1995 is of concern. A survey compared syrup of ipecac use by CSPI, ABAT, and ABMT/ACMT members as the first response decontamination. The survey asked CSPI, ABAT, and ABMT/ACMT members their professional opinion on the use of syrup of ipecac in a potentially toxic ingestion. The scenario was ""Your 2-y-old child/grandchild accidentally ingested a potentially lethal dose of poison (i.e. colchicine) 5 min ago and you have syrup of ipecac at home. Would you consider using it?"" Of the 171 CSPI's who responded, 34.5% favored the use of syrup of ipecac while 63% were against and 2.3% needed more information. Of the 26 ABAT's who responded, 50% favored it's use, 42.3% would not and 7.6% needed more information. From the 55 ABMT/ACMT members who responded, 81.8% would use ipecac while 18.1% would not. ABMT/ACMT members favored the use of syrup of ipecac in this scenario (P < 0.005), while the CSPI's did not (P < 0.005), and the ABAT's did not have statistical difference. With CSPI's providing the treatment recommendations from poison centers, it is important that ABMT/ACMT members influence the recommended treatment protocols.",0
https://doi.org/10.1176/ps.2008.59.5.534,Special Section on Implications of CATIE: Impact of the CATIE Findings on State Mental Health Policy,"The authors, who are medical directors of three state mental health agencies and members of the Medical Directors' Council of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), describe the impact on public mental health policy of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Before publication of the CATIE results, the preponderance of information indicated substantial and broad-ranging advantages of second-generation antipsychotics over first-generation agents. State mental health authorities focused on improving access to and increasing utilization of the newer agents. In many states, expenditures for these agents accounted for 10% of the total pharmacy budget of the Medicaid program. After CATIE, state policy makers have had to take a more critical look at the data and formulate more nuanced approaches. The authors summarize policy recommendations of the NASMHPD Medical Directors' Council, which reviewed efficacy studies of antipsychotics and formulated a position statement. The recommendations cover three broad areas of policy. First, neither complete open access for all patients at all times nor a uniform fail-first trial of a first-generation antipsychotic is an optimal approach. A more nuanced middle ground is necessary. Second, excessive emphasis on the cost of second-generation antipsychotics has led to a lack of focus on optimizing use of all antipsychotic medication in usual practice. More research and management attention must be focused on improving how these medications are prescribed for individual patients. Third, more resources should be invested in clinical trials that more clearly and accurately reflect current practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-003-1238-8,The potential of Prunus davidiana for introgression into peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] assessed by comparative mapping,"The potential for introgression of Prunus davidiana, a wild species related to peach, was evaluated with respect to problems of non-Mendelian segregation or suppressed recombination which often hamper breeding processes based on interspecific crosses. Three connected (F1, F2 and BC2) populations, derived from a cross between P. davidiana clone P1908 and the peach cultivar Summergrand were used. The intraspecific map of P. davidiana already established using the F1 progeny was complemented, and two interspecific maps, for the F2 and BC2 progenies, were built with a set of markers selected from the Prunus reference map. With the molecular data collected for the F2 map construction, regions with distorted marker segregation were detected on the genome; one third of all loci deviated significantly from the expected Mendelian ratios. However, some of these distorted segregations were probably not due to the interspecific cross. On linkage group 6, a skewed area under gametic selection was most likely influenced by the self-incompatibility gene of P. davidiana. Using anchor loci, a good colinearity between the three maps built and the Prunus reference map was demonstrated. Comparative mapping also revealed that homologous recombination occurred normally between P. davidiana and the Prunus persica genome. This confirmed the closeness of the two species. Higher recombination rates were generally observed between P. davidiana and P. persica than between Prunus amygdalus and P. persica. The consequences for plant breeding strategy are discussed. The three maps of the F1, F2 and BC2 progenies provide useful tools for QTL detection and marker-assisted selection, as well as for assessing the efficiency of the peach breeding scheme applied to introgress P. davidiana genes into peach cultivated varieties.",0

,Oral contraceptive and anesthesia,Current oral contraceptive (OCs) use is associated with a fivefold increased risk of perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although the absolute number of patient who develops perioperative VTE when taking OCs is small (15-25 per 100000 person-years) the newer OC contains desogestrel as progestogen (the third generation OC) is found to have slightly greater risk of VTE than the older OCs. WHO criteria for the use of oral contraceptive third edition (2004) classifies only the major surgery with prolonged immobilization as Category 4 where oral contraceptive is not to be used. On the contrary Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare prohibits OCs in all kinds of surgery. Although the restraint of perioperative OCs administration is invalid it would be prudent to halt perioperative OCs in Japan.,0
,Issues in the management of bacterial meningitis.,"Acute bacterial meningitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite the availability of effective antimicrobial therapy. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in recent years has necessitated the development of new strategies for empiric antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis. Specifically, the emergence of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae that are resistant to penicillin and the cephalosporins have led to empiric therapy for patients with pneumococcal meningitis consisting of vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin pending susceptibility testing. Third-generation cephalosporins are also effective as empiric therapy against other pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial meningitis, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes, for which ampicillin or penicillin G is the antimicrobial agent of choice. Adjunctive dexamethasone should be administered to infants and children with suspected or proven Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis to reduce audiologic and neurologic sequelae; administration concomitant with or just before the first dose of the antimicrobial agent is optimal for best results.",0

One was cemented using modern ""third generation"" cementing techniques, while the second group utilizes these same steps as well as a vacuum assist (weep-hole) technique. We measured the ""amount"" of cement that penetrated the vault around either a pegged or keeled component as a function of the area of the cement noted on the fluoroscopic AP film that was taken 35.1 months postoperatively. We were able to determine the area of this irregular shape by using a program that was specifically written for the study. The films were evaluated by the senior author, as well as 2 musculoskeletal trained radiologists blind to the technique.The area of the cement mantle was found to be significantly larger (P < .005) in the group with the vacuum assist technique. There was a positive relationship between the durability of the cement mantle as determined by the presence and the extent of radiolucent lines and the size of the cement mantle (P < .001).If a cement technique is chosen to implant a glenoid component, the vacuum assist weep-hole technique is the most effective cementing technique to achieve durable fixation.",0

Identifying risk factors early in life can facilitate use of preventive strategies to reduce risk and improve health status across the life span.The aim of this study was to identify modifiable (tobacco smoke exposure, physical inactivity, dietary fat intake, overweight, and high blood pressure [BP]) and nonmodifiable (family history, gender, and age) cardiovascular risk factors in low-income preschool children.Low-income preschool children (N = 205) 3-5 years old were recruited to participate. Parents completed a multigenerational cardiovascular health history form and a 24-hour dietary recall for themselves and their child. The children's height, weight, and BP were obtained.Of the 205 children, 61% reported ethnicity as Latino or Hispanic, 31.7% non-Hispanic White, 1% non-Hispanic Black, 3.9% Asian, and 2.4% mixed race. The number of males (50.7%) and females (49.3%) was similar. Only 22 (10.7%) children had no identified cardiovascular risk factors. At least one modifiable risk factor was present in 179 (87.3%) children. Fifty-two (25.5%) children had a body mass index (BMI) > or = 85th percentile for gender and age; 44 (22.3%) had a systolic or diastolic BP over the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height; 128 (66.3%) had a dietary fat intake of > 30%; 77 (37.6%) watched TV or played video games more than 2 hr/day; and 48 (23.4%) were exposed to passive tobacco smoke.The identification of cardiovascular risk factors in almost 90% of presumably healthy preschoolers provides evidence to support testing of interventions that can improve health behaviors and reduce risks.",0
,[2 autopsy cases of congenital muscular dystrophy of Fukuyama type--a typical and an atypical cases].,"Two autopsy cases of congenital muscular dystrophy of Fukuyama type (F-CMD) were described. The first case was diagnosed clinically and pathologically as its typical case. Neither his family history nor the history of his prenatal period were contributory. He had suffered from muscle weakness and atrophy since his birth. Serum CPK was markedly elevated. EMG and muscle biopsy proved dystrophic changes of the skeletal muscles. In addition, he manifested mental retardation and attacks of convulsion. EEG failed to elicit remarkable changes, but PEG represented ventricular dilatation. He died of respiratory insufficiency at age 12. His postmortem examination showed variegated anomalies in the nervous system. Extensive micropolygyria was present in the cerebrum and cerebellum accompanied by adhesions between the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Assymmetry of the longitudinal fibers was pointed out in the pontine base. Anterior horn cells were atrophic and moderately depopulated. On the other hand, the second patient was an atypical F-CMD case in symptoms, signs and pathology. His grand-mothers on both father's and mother's sides wee first cousins. His three siblings showed no similar disorders. His mother developed slight gestational toxicosis in the sixth and seventh months of pregnancy. His muscle weakness, contracture of the bilateral hip-joints and clubfoot had been observed since his birth. Physical and neurological examinations at age 6 showed deformity of the skull, myopathic face, macroglossia, high-arched palate, pigeon chest, scoliosis of the thoracic spine. In addition, generalized muscular atrophy, hypotonia and areflexia were recognized. Pseudohypertrophy of the muscles was absent. Sensation was intact to all modalities. Serum CPK and LDH were moderately increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0
,Building a dialysis facility within the confines of a skilled nursing facility.,"Creating a dialysis facility within an existing SNF will cost more money then building an independent dialysis facility. If a new building is created and is physically attached to the existing SNF, it will have to meet the regulations that apply to the SNF. It is possible to build a new building adjacent to but not connected with the SNF without having to meet SNF requirements. If this is an option, then it is imperative to determine with the local authorities how much space must be between the structures. If the decision is made to build within the physical confines of the existing SNF, the SNF may no longer meet current regulations. In some cases I have seen, the SNF facility was older and had been grandfathered under current regulations. When the building inspector and fire marshall inspected the new dialysis unit, they made the determination that the SNF had to be upgraded to meet some of the current regulations. This was a very costly situation for the SNF. If the organization is considering creating a dialysis unit in conjunction with a SNF, I would recommend the dialysis unit be constructed as a new, separate building on the campus rather then within the existing building. The combination of these two types of care can be very positive both for the patients and the organizations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-006-0317-x,Are radiogallium-labelled DOTA-conjugated somatostatin analogues superior to those labelled with other radiometals?,"Gallium-68 is a metallic positron emitter with a half-life of 68 min that is ideal for the in vivo use of small molecules, such as [68Ga-DOTA,Tyr3]octreotide, in the diagnostic imaging of somatostatin receptor-positive tumours. In preclinical studies it has shown a striking superiority over its 111In-labelled congener. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether third-generation somatostatin-based, radiogallium-labelled peptides show the same superiority.Peptides were synthesised on solid phase. The receptor affinity was determined by in vitro receptor autoradiography. The internalisation rate was studied in AR4-2J and hsst-HEK-transfected cell lines. The pharmacokinetics was studied in a rat xenograft tumour model, AR4-2J.All peptides showed high affinities on hsst2, with the highest affinity for the Ga(III)-complexed peptides. On hsst3 the situation was reversed, with a trend towards lower affinity of the Ga(III) peptides. A significantly increased internalisation rate was found in sst2-expressing cells for all 67Ga-labelled peptides. Internalisation into HEK-sst3 was usually faster for the 111In-labelled peptides. No internalisation was found into sst5. Biodistribution studies employing [67Ga-DOTA,1-Nal3]octreotide in comparison to [111In-DOTA,1-Nal3]octreotide and [67Ga-DOTA,Tyr3]octreotide showed a significantly higher and receptor-mediated uptake of the two 67Ga-labelled peptides in the tumour and somatostatin receptor-positive tissues. A patient study illustrated the potential advantage of a broad receptor subtype profile radiopeptide over a high-affinity sst2-selective radiopeptide.This study demonstrates that 67/68Ga-DOTA-octapeptides show distinctly better preclinical, pharmacological performances than the 111In-labelled peptides, especially on sst2-expressing cells and the corresponding animal models. They may be excellent candidates for further development for clinical studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.11176,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele: a decision analysis,"To determine whether prenatal myelomeningocele repair is a cost-effective strategy compared to postnatal repair.Decision-analysis modeling was used to calculate the cumulative costs, effects and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prenatal myelomeningocele repair compared with postnatal repair in singleton gestations with a normal karyotype that were identified with myelomeningocele between T1 and S1. The model accounted for costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in three populations: (1) myelomeningocele patients; (2) mothers carrying myelomeningocele patients; and (3) possible future siblings of these patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed using one-way, two-way and Monte Carlo simulations.Prenatal myelomeningocele repair saves $ 2 066 778 per 100 cases repaired. Additionally, prenatal surgery results in 98 QALYs gained per 100 repairs with 42 fewer neonates requiring shunts and 21 fewer neonates requiring long-term medical care per 100 repairs. However, these benefits are coupled to 26 additional cases of uterine rupture or dehiscence and one additional case of neurologic deficits in future offspring per 100 repairs. Results were robust in sensitivity analysis.Prenatal myelomeningocele repair is cost effective and frequently cost saving compared with postnatal myelomeningocele repair despite the increased likelihood of maternal and future pregnancy complications associated with prenatal surgery.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00467.x,Optimal and Acceptable Technical Facilities Involving Risks,"Economic cost-benefit optimization of technical facility requires suitable ""life saving cost"" and/or an appropriate acceptance criterion if human life and limb are at risk. Traditionally, acceptance criteria implicit in codes of practice, standards, or regulations for well-defined fields of application are calibrated against past and present practice. This is all but satisfying. It is unclear whether present rules are already optimal. Extrapolations into new fields of application are extremely difficult. Direct cost-benefit analysis is proposed as an alternative. Based on the recently proposed ""life quality index"" (LQI), a rational acceptance criterion and so-called life saving cost are derived. The classical life quality index is reviewed, modified, and imbedded in modern economics theory. The results are then applied to technical facilities. The relation between optimization and the LQI-based acceptance criterion is discussed. The relevant economics literature is reviewed with respect to discount rates applicable for long-term investments into risk reduction. They should be as low as possible according to a recent mathematical result. Modern economic growth theory decomposes the output growth rate into the rate of time preference of consumption and the rate of economical growth multiplied by the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption. It is found that the rate of time preference of consumption should be a little larger than the long-term population growth rate. The public benefit rate (output growth rate) on the other hand should be smaller than the sum of the population growth rate and the long-term growth rate of a national economy, which is around 2% for most industrial countries. Accordingly, the rate of time preference of consumption is about 1%, which is also intergenerationally acceptable from an ethical point of view. Given a certain output growth rate there is a corresponding maximum financial interest rate in order to maintain nonnegativity of the objective function at the optimum. Finally, a simple demonstration example is added.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-6915(93)90079-e,Toxicological studies on debitterized neem oil (Azadirachta indica),"Azadirachta indica, popularly known as 'Neem' in India, is widely grown all over the tropics. The seed contains 45% oil and is a minor oil of considerable potential. Neem oil is bitter and inedible. Recently, a method has been developed to completely remove the bitter and odoriferous principles and leave a bitterless, odourless and colourless oil. The nutritional and chemical evaluation of debitterized neem oil (NO) was reported earlier (C. Rukmini, Food Chemistry 1987, 26, 119). We report here a three-generation study, carried out according to WHO/FDA protocol in groups of 15 male and 15 female rats fed a diet containing 10% NO or groundnut oil (GNO). Reproductive toxicology was monitored for three generations. The results obtained in both the matings in all the three generations did not show any adverse effects on the reproductive parameters studied in rats fed NO and were similar to those observed in rats fed GNO. The mean organ weights and the histopathological evaluation of all the organs were similar to those of the control (GNO-fed) rats. A mutagenicity test of NO was also found to be negative in Ames test as reported earlier (K. Polasa and C. Rukmini, Food and Chemical Toxicology 1987, 25, 763). These studies indicate that NO devoid of all the bitter and odoriferous principles, may be recommended as safe for consumption by humans.",1

The kVCT and MVCT images were aligned for setup verification purposes, allowing repositioning before treatment delivery. <h3>Results</h3> Tumors are readily visualized on the MVCT images. At a dose of 2–3 cGy, the MVCT images are of sufficient quality for verification of treatment setup, but soft-tissue contrast is inferior to that with conventional kVCT. The MV and kVCT images were successfully aligned. When necessary, patients undergoing helical tomotherapy were repositioned before treatment. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Megavoltage CT image quality is sufficient for tumor identification and three-dimensional setup verification in dogs with spontaneous tumors. The MVCT images can be aligned with the planning kVCT to ensure proper patient registration before treatment. Image alignment was successful in these canine patients, despite no skin markings defining patient positioning between the two scans. MVCT images facilitate setup verification, and their tomographic nature offers improvements over conventional portal imaging.",0

The rehabilitated litters contained females and pups fed an adequate diet for up to three generations after a history of malnutrition. In the current study, a 2 X 2 cross-over design was used during the lactation period in which rehabilitated mothers suckled rehabilitated pups or well-nourished control pups, and control mothers similarly suckled rehabilitated or control pups. We found that maternal factors were dominant in determining the amount of active nursing, and that pup factors modified the maternal influence on other lactation-related behaviors.",1

https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-535,Low level of alcohol drinking among two generations of non-Western immigrants in Oslo: a multi-ethnic comparison,"Alcohol drinking is a risk factor for harm and disease. A low level of drinking among non-Western immigrants may lead to less alcohol-related harm and disease. The first aim of this study was to describe frequency of drinking in two generations of immigrants in Oslo, contrasting the result to drinking frequency among ethnic Norwegians. The second aim was to study how frequency of drinking among adult immigrants was associated with social interaction with their own countrymen and ethnic Norwegians, acculturation, age, gender, socioeconomic factors and the Muslim faith.The Oslo Health Study (HUBRO) was conducted during the period 2000 to 2002 and consisted of three separate surveys: a youth study (15-16-year-olds, a total of 7343 respondents, response rate 88.3%); adult cohorts from 30 to 75 years old (18,770 respondents, response rate 46%); the five largest immigrant groups in Oslo (aged 20-60 years, a total of 3019 respondents, response rate 39.7%). Based on these three surveys, studies of frequency of drinking in the previous year (four categories) were conducted among 15-16-year-olds and their parents' generation, 30-60-year-old Iranians, Pakistanis, Turks and ethnic Norwegians. A structural equation model with drinking frequency as outcome was established for the adult immigrants.Adults and youth of ethnic Norwegian background reported more frequent alcohol use than immigrants with backgrounds from Iran, Turkey and Pakistan. Iranians reported a higher drinking frequency than Turks and Pakistanis. In the structural equation model high drinking frequency was associated with high host culture competence and social interaction, while high own culture competence was associated with low drinking frequency. Adult first-generation immigrants with a longer stay in Norway, those of a higher age, and females drank alcohol less frequently, while those with a higher level of education and work participation drank more frequently. Muslim immigrants reported a significantly lower drinking frequency than non-Muslims, although this did not apply to Iranians.The existence and growth in Western societies of immigrant groups with low-level alcohol consumption contributed to a lower level of consumption at the population level. This may imply reduced drinking and alcohol-related harm and disease even among ethnic Norwegians.",0

We have further analyzed these lines and additional related germplasm with publicly available STS and SSRs. Primers which showed a polymorphism between wheat and P-29, were tested in all recombinant and nulli-tetrasomic lines confirming their position on chromosome 7D. The resulting 7D/7E chromosome maps appeared as a mosaic of wheat and Th. intermedium chromatin sections. To verify the composition of the translocation lines suggested by the RFLP-PCR map, F(2) progeny of two crosses (CS/216-1 and CS/260-1) were analyzed with molecular markers. Both populations gave an unexpectedly diverse number of recombinant individuals, suggesting that interstitial translocations occur more frequently than previously thought. This analysis also showed that there is a wide range in the number and position of the interstitial translocations within a given line such as the mosaic chromosome in recombinant line 260-1/CS-26, which has four Th. intermedium chromosome segments. Phenotypic data of the two populations suggested the presence of one gene which we have called Bdv3 to differentiate it from the previously reported orthologous gene Bdv2. Using the PCR-based molecular markers identified in this study, 5 out of 12 elite lines that showed good yields and no YDV symptoms contained Th. intermedium chromatin. Due to the multiple components involved in the YDV disease complex, combining selection for YDV resistance with the molecular markers and maps identified in this study will increase the efficiency of introgressing Th. intermedium chromatin containing YDV resistance or other beneficial traits into elite wheat germplasm.",0

Mothers of under five children attending five purposively selected public health facilities in the Kibaha district, Tanzania, were invited to participate in 10 focus group discussions (FGDs). The health workers of these facilities were included in six other FGDs to elicit their professional views. Analysis was done using interpretative and qualitative approaches. Both health workers and all mothers were clear about the signs and symptoms of homa ya malaria, a description consistent with the biomedical definition of mild malaria. Although most of the mothers related this to mosquito bites, some did not. Mothers also described a severe childhood illness called degedege, consistent with convulsions. Most of the mothers failed to associate this condition with malaria, believing it is caused by evil spirits. Urinating on or fuming the child suffering from degedege with elephant dung were perceived to be effective remedies while injections were considered fatal for such condition. Traditional healers were seen as the primary source of treatment outside homes for this condition and grandmothers and mother in-laws are the key decision makers in the management. Our findings revealed major gaps in managing severe malaria in the study communities. Interventions addressing these gaps and targeting mothers/guardians, mother in-laws, grandmothers and traditional healers are needed.",0

Genetic contribution was assessed by measuring the relative frequency of immigrant marker alleles in the first and second generations after immigration, while controlling for any selection effects at the marker locus, and for the experience of male immigrants. When immigrants were outbred, the mean frequency of the immigrant allele was significantly higher than its initial frequency, in both the first and second generations after immigration. There was no significant change in allele frequency for populations receiving inbred immigrants. The increase in allele frequency for outbred immigrants was attributed to an initial outbred vigour fitness advantage of immigrant males over resident males experiencing inbreeding depression. Hybrid vigour of immigrant progeny and the rare-male effect did not have a statistically significant role in the fitness advantage of the immigrant allele. The results suggest that inbreeding may have a considerable impact on the contribution of immigrants to the genetic diversity of populations.",0

This study was undertaken to delineate whether transketolase abnormality (i.e., high Michaelis Menton constant (Km) for thiamine pyrophosphate), previously reported in patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is prevalent among familial chronic alcoholic men and their sons without prior history of alcohol abuse but who are at high risk for alcoholism. Our data suggest that an inborn error (i.e., high Km of transketolase for thiamine pyrophosphate) predisposing to thiamine deficiency diseases similar to those reported in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome may occur in the general population. However, for some as yet unexplained reason(s) this variant seems to occur more frequently among familial chronic alcoholic men and their male offspring without any history of alcoholism. The inheritance pattern of this enzyme variant as revealed from an Amish pedigree study may be autosomal recessive as previously suggested.",0

Otopharyngeal infection, haematogenous spread and cranial neurosurgery continue to be the predominant routes of infection. Most patients acquired the infection in the community, and predisposing underlying conditions are common. The proportion of S. pneumoniae meningitis compared to all microorganisms causing meningitis in adults declined dramatically from 17% in the first 8 study years to 4% in the last 8 study years. However, all penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains were found in the second half of the study period, accounting for 25% of these episodes. The overall mortality rates for the first and second halves of the study period were 43% and 63%, respectively. Third-generation cephalosporins were the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of S. pneumoniae meningitis in this study, however, the emergence of resistant strains may create a therapeutic challenge in the future. To avoid treatment failure, early diagnosis, careful monitoring of the clinical course and the choice of appropriate antibiotics according to the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities, are necessary.",0

We performed hand-pollinations to verify outcomes of self- and cross-fertilisation over two generations, and grew inbred and outbred D. guliae offspring under different conditions - in pots, a common garden and field conditions (with/without nutrient addition). The environment influenced juvenile growth and flowering likelihood/rate, but had little effect on inbreeding depression. Significant interactions among genetic and environmental factors influenced female fertility. Overall, genetic factors strongly affected both early (seed mass, seed germination, early survival) and late (seed/ovule ratio) life-history traits. After the first pollination experiment, we detected higher mortality in the selfed progeny, which is possibly a consequence of inbreeding depression caused by over-expression of early-acting deleterious alleles. The second pollination induced a strong loss of reproductive fitness (seed production, seed mass) in inbred D. guliae offspring, regardless of the pollination treatment (selfing/crossing); hence, a strong (genetic) maternal influence constrained early life-history traits of the second generation. Based on current knowledge, we conclude that self-compatibility does not prevent the detrimental effects of inbreeding in D. guliae populations, and may increase the severe extinction risk if out-crossing rates decrease.",0

Two patients were operated on for histopathologically proven cervical spinal neurofibromas. All patients had café au lait spots, one had several freckles in the axillary area, and two had possible dermal neurofibromas, but iris Lisch-nodules were not present. Other signs of neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were absent. A linkage study of the family suggested close linkage to the NF1 locus and excluded it from the NF2 locus. The DNA analysis of histopathologically verified spinal neurofibromas in two patients showed no evidence of LOH at 17q11.2. The findings in the present family, together with those in a family previously described, suggest a clinically distinct form of neurofibromatosis with extensive spinal neurofibromas and café au lait macules, which may be allelic to the NF1 gene.",0

Infected newborn hamsters initially developed a persistent viremia and viruria with titers often in excess of 10(4.0) mean infectious doses/0.03 ml of blood or urine. After week 12 two different patterns of infection became evident. Approximately one-half of the hamsters eventually cleared the infection, whereas the others developed a chronic progressive and ultimalely fatal disease characterized by continuous high-titered viremia and viruria and high titers of virus in their tissues. Complement-fixing antibody and, to a lesser degree, virus-neutralizing antibody coexisted with the viremia. Hamsters with persistently high levels of viremia and viruria developed chronic glomerulonephritis and widespread vasculitis, whereas hamsters that cleared their infections did not develop these lesions. Litters of hamsters born to viremic mothers were invariably infected. Litter sizes were small and breeding effectiveness was reduce; however, vertical, congenital infection was successfully passed through three generations. The course of infection in the congenitally infected hamsters was similar to that in newborn infected hamsters, with all animals producing complement-fixing antibody, some animals being capable of clearing the viremia and remaining healthy, and other animals having persistent viremia and fatal disease. Inoculated young adult hamsters did not become diseased, developed viremia and viruria which persisted up to 3 and 6 months, respectively, and developed complement-fixing antibody by 10 days after infection. The prolonged urinary excretion of large amounts of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus by asymptomatic, chronically infected hamsters is an important public health consideration when dealing with potential human infection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-09-2917,"Targeting the Cytoprotective Chaperone, Clusterin, for Treatment of Advanced Cancer","Abstract Many strategies used to kill cancer cells induce stress-responses that activate survival pathways to promote emergence of a treatment resistant phenotype. Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is a stress-activated cytoprotective chaperone up-regulated by many varied anticancer therapies to confer treatment resistance when overexpressed. sCLU levels are increased in several treatment recurrent cancers including castrate resistant prostate cancer, and therefore sCLU has become an attractive target in cancer therapy. sCLU is not druggable with small molecule inhibitors, therefore nucleotide-based strategies to inhibit sCLU at the RNA level are appealing. Preclinical studies have shown that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or siRNA knockdown of sCLU have preclinical activity in combination with hormone- and chemotherapy. Phase I and II clinical trial data indicate that the second generation ASO, custirsen (OGX-011), has biologic and clinical activity, suppressing sCLU expression in prostate cancer tissues by more than 90%. A randomized study comparing docetaxel-custirsen to docetaxel alone in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer reported improved survival by 7 months from 16.9 to 23.8 months. Strong preclinical and clinical proof-of-principle data provide rationale for further study of sCLU inhibitors in randomized phase III trials, which are planned to begin in 2010.

Treatment of HIV infection, therefore, must reach these cells in addition to the lymphocytes. The purpose of the present study is to develop poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimer-based nanocontainers for targeting of efavirenz (EFV) to Mo/Mac. Fifth generation PPI dendrimer, t-Boc-glycine conjugated PPI dendrimer (TPPI) and mannose conjugated dendrimers were synthesized and characterized. While the haemolytic activity and cytotoxicity of PPI dendrimer was found to be very high, the toxicity of t-Boc-glycine conjugated dendrimer and mannose conjugated dendrimers were found to be negligible. The entrapment efficiency of mannose conjugated dendrimer was found to be 47.4%, followed by that of PPI dendrimer (32.15%) and t-Boc-glycine conjugated dendrimer (23.1%). The in vitro drug release profile shows that while PPI dendrimer releases the drug by 24 h, the dendrimer-based nanocontainers prolong the release rate up to 144 h (83 +/- 0.4% in case of t-Boc-glycine conjugated dendrimer and 91 +/- 0.3% in mannose conjugated dendrimer). The cellular uptake of EFV was found to be both concentration and time dependent. Significant increase in cellular uptake of EFV by Mo/Mac cells were observed in case of mannose conjugated dendrimer which is 12 times higher than that of free drug and 5.5 times higher than that of t-Boc-glycine conjugated dendrimer. While mannose conjugated dendrimer was taken up by the lectin receptors of the cells, phagocytosis of t-Boc-glycine conjugated dendrimer might be responsible for its enhanced uptake. Results suggest that the proposed carriers hold potential to increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of antiretroviral therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2010.6,"A common variant of the latrophilin 3 gene, LPHN3, confers susceptibility to ADHD and predicts effectiveness of stimulant medication.","Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has a very high heritability (0.8), suggesting that about 80% of phenotypic variance is due to genetic factors. We used the integration of statistical and functional approaches to discover a novel gene that contributes to ADHD. For our statistical approach, we started with a linkage study based on large multigenerational families in a population isolate, followed by fine mapping of targeted regions using a family-based design. Family- and population-based association studies in five samples from disparate regions of the world were used for replication. Brain imaging studies were performed to evaluate gene function. The linkage study discovered a genome region harbored in the Latrophilin 3 gene (LPHN3). In the world-wide samples (total n=6360, with 2627 ADHD cases and 2531 controls) statistical association of LPHN3 and ADHD was confirmed. Functional studies revealed that LPHN3 variants are expressed in key brain regions related to attention and activity, affect metabolism in neural circuits implicated in ADHD, and are associated with response to stimulant medication. Linkage and replicated association of ADHD with a novel non-candidate gene (LPHN3) provide new insights into the genetics, neurobiology, and treatment of ADHD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01309739,Analysis of host genetic control of scrapie-induced obesity,"The potential for induction of obesity during the preclinical phase of scrapie disease in mice was previously shown to be a function of both the strain of scrapie and the strain of inbred mouse. In the present study, host control of obesity induction by a scrapie strain was examined to determine if the effect were dependent on a single gene or multiple genes. The approach used was assessment of the pattern of weight induction in F1 and F2 crosses of parental inbred mouse strains that did or did not show a weight increase with a specific scrapie strain. Analyses of these data indicated that the induction of obesity was controlled by multiple host genes. In an unrelated observation, there was a correlation between the incubation period of a strain of scrapie in F2 generation mice and their coat color, i.e., the average incubation period of yellow-brown mice was significantly less than those of either black or white mice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1161/hc5790.094909,Conceptus Radiation Dose and Risk From Cardiac Catheter Ablation Procedures,"The aim of the current study was to estimate the conceptus radiation dose and risk associated with fluoroscopic imaging during a catheter ablation procedure for supraventricular tachycardia performed on the expectant mother.Exposure parameters and fluoroscopy times for each projection of the cardiac ablation procedure performed in 20 female patients of childbearing age were recorded. Radiation doses for a potential conceptus were estimated by using dose data obtained in anthropomorphic phantoms simulating pregnancy at the first, second, and third trimesters. Dose measurements were carried out using thermoluminescent dosimeters. For a typical examination, the average radiation dose to the conceptus was <1 mGy in all periods of gestation. Average excess fatal cancer was 14.5/10(6) unborn children irradiated during the first postconception weeks. Corresponding values for the second and third trimesters were 30 and 55.7/10(6), respectively. The risk for hereditary effects in future generations was 1.5/10(6) cases for conceptus irradiation during the first postconception weeks. Corresponding values for the second and third trimesters were 3.0 and 5.6/10(6), respectively. Formulas and dose data are presented for estimating the conceptus risk from any technique and x-ray system used for catheter ablation procedures.A typical catheter ablation procedure results in a very small increase in risk of harmful effects to the conceptus. However, estimation of conceptus dose from catheter ablation procedures is always needed to assess the risk to the individual developing in utero.",0
,"Is cervical cancer screening necessary or the ""Paradox"" example of Bulgaria.","PURPOSE The present study aimed at analyzing the results of cervical screening carried out in Bulgaria, its effect on basic epidemiological indices, age-related incidence of cervical cancer and their dynamics. It also highlighted the way in which the suspension of organized screening has influenced the epidemiological data for cervical cancer. METHODS Analyses were carried out, based on data from the National Cancer Register, the Central Institute of Statistics and the Oncological Dispensaries. Simple mathematical methods were used to analyze the attendance rate, the rate of inadequate smears and share of biopsies in women with abnormal cytology. Cohort analysis was utilized in determining age-specific incidence. RESULTS Incidence and mortality were stable during the first 15 years of screening activities, followed by a constant increase which became most obvious after the final interruption of organized screening. The ratio between invasive cancer and carcinoma in situ ranged from 2:1 in 1982 to over 5:1 in 2002 and was due to the faster increasing rates of invasive cancer. Age groups' and birth-cohort analysis for 3 time points (1975, 1990, and 2005) with different screening characteristics showed highest incidence in middle-aged women and a higher risk of cervical cancer for every subsequent generation. CONCLUSION Bulgaria gives yet another, though paradoxical, example in support of the importance of organized cervical screening. This conclusion has been reinforced by a distinct deterioration of epidemiological characteristics of cervical cancer in our country as a result of absence of an organized screening. This serious situation lends valid reasons to recommend that the relevant health authorities take a political decision to launch a programme in compliance with the European standards.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10500,Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns,"DNA molecules provide what is probably the most iconic example of self-replication--the ability of a system to replicate, or make copies of, itself. In living cells the process is mediated by enzymes and occurs autonomously, with the number of replicas increasing exponentially over time without the need for external manipulation. Self-replication has also been implemented with synthetic systems, including RNA enzymes designed to undergo self-sustained exponential amplification. An exciting next step would be to use self-replication in materials fabrication, which requires robust and general systems capable of copying and amplifying functional materials or structures. Here we report a first development in this direction, using DNA tile motifs that can recognize and bind complementary tiles in a pre-programmed fashion. We first design tile motifs so they form a seven-tile seed sequence; then use the seeds to instruct the formation of a first generation of complementary seven-tile daughter sequences; and finally use the daughters to instruct the formation of seven-tile granddaughter sequences that are identical to the initial seed sequences. Considering that DNA is a functional material that can organize itself and other molecules into useful structures, our findings raise the tantalizing prospect that we may one day be able to realize self-replicating materials with various patterns or useful functions.",0

Patients who survived meningoencephalitis were asked to come to a neurological examination. Neuropsychological status, EEG and Tc-HMPAO-Spect were also performed in these patients. The patients were treated with a combination of three antimicrobial agents which was commonly used at our hospital during the investigation time consisting of penicillin, a cephalosporine of the third generation and an aminoglycoside. 40% of the patients suffered from more or less severe neurologic sequelae; remaining cognitive deficits were also frequent. On the whole there was a tendency towards improvement in patients who suffered from less severe deficits at the time of discharge from hospital, patients with more severe deficits also showed slight improvement but generally did not reach a restitutio ad integrum. Regarding this, in our opinion a broad initial antimicrobial therapy should be used, although a statistically significant improvement of the patient's outcome by this could not be shown. Lethality as well as the frequency of complications do not seem to differ over many years although antimicrobial and intensive care treatment were improved. Thus, the outcome seems to depend largely on the occurrence of secondary focal complications or brain oedema.",0

Methods G-banded chromosome analysis, array-CGH, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) were used to ascertain the karyotype of the patient and her relatives. Results G-banding analysis of the patient showed a derivative chromosome 10 with an extra fragment on its long arm terminal, both her father and grandmother had an apparently balanced translocation t(4;10)(q25;q26). Array-CGH revealed that the breakpoint on chromosome 4 was located at 4q26. In addition, a microdeletion of about 0. 54 Mb del(10)(q26. 3) was identified from the patient. FISH and RQ-PCR confirmed that the del(10)(q26.3) was also present in both her father and grandmother. Conclusion No recognizable phenotype was associated with del(10)(q26.3). The abnormal phenotypes presented in the patient may be ascribed to the 4q26-q35.2 triplication.

Visitation laws have evolved toward more expansive rights for grandparents that reduce the parents' relative legal authority. Psychological research suggests that court-ordered visitation imposed in high-conflict situations over parental opposition may be detrimental to children. Grandparents who take on parenting roles for their grandchildren may become involved in legal custody disputes. The custodial relationships that can be created between grandparents and grandchildren include formal custody, foster care, guardianship, and adoption.",0
,[Relations between grandparents and grandchildren].,"In spite of the steadily increasing number of grandparents there is only few research on this subject. In four studies we tried to elaborate forms of interaction between grandparents and grandchildren of different age groups. The samples comprised grandparent-grandchildren pairs, which were explored separately in an extensive way (altogether 232 subjects). Comparative results on contact-frequency, styles of grandparenting, functions of grandparents, meaning of the parent-generation and--only for the elder people--perception of own grandparents as well as satisfaction with the grandparent role are reported and discussed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.3.491,Bone Turnover Response to Changes in Calcium Intake Is Altered in Girls and Adult Women in Families with Histories of Osteoporosis,"Heredity and environmental factors contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Because calcium is the major mineral in bone and adolescence is a key period in bone acquisition, we hypothesized that bone turnover would be less responsive to alterations in dietary calcium intake in both girls and adult women from families with histories of osteoporosis. To address this issue, we studied calcium kinetics in the maternal grandmother (age range 56–81 years), mother (age range 32–47 years), and granddaughter (age range 8–15 years) in 10 multigenerational families. In five families, the mother and/or grandmother had osteoporosis (bone mineral density ≥ 2 SD below the age-specific mean). To examine both active and passive calcium absorption, families consumed low- (279 ± 64 mg/day) and high- (1580 ± 385) calcium diets for 10 days prior to administration of oral (46Ca) and intravenous (42Ca) stable isotopes. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, fractional calcium absorption, true calcium absorption, bone calcium deposition, and the balance in bone calcium turnover were all significantly affected by diet (p < 0.01). Females from nonosteoporotic families had decreased bone calcium resorption with little change in bone calcium deposition during the high-calcium study. In contrast, girls and adult women from osteoporotic families had increased both bone calcium deposition and resorption during the high-calcium period, leading to a less positive balance in bone calcium turnover. A significant interaction between bone status and diet was found for bone calcium resorption (p < 0.05) and approached significance for bone calcium deposition (p < 0.07), effects which were independent of generation. We conclude that girls and women from osteoporotic families have a significantly altered bone turnover response to acute changes in calcium intake.",0
https://doi.org/10.1243/095441105x9219,A new design concept for wrist arthroplasty,"The wrist joint is frequently affected by arthritis, which leads to pain, loss of function and ultimately deformity. Various designs of wrist arthroplasty have been introduced to attempt to relieve pain and provide a functional range of motion. The first generation of wrist implant was a one-piece silicone elastomer. Later generations have designs that have two parts that articulate against each other. However, wrist implants have not achieved the same clinical success to date, compared with hip and knee implants, and there is a high revision rate associated with them. This paper describes a new design concept for wrist arthroplasty, based around the idea of combining the principles of an articulating implant with that of a flexible elastomer implant. The design consists of assembling a radial, carpal/metacarpal, plate and flexible parts together. The radial and carpal/metacarpal parts are to be made from ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The bearing surfaces of the radial and carpal/metacarpal parts articulate against the flat surfaces of the plate, made from cobalt chrome molybdenum alloy. The radius on the bearing surface of the radial part enables flexion/extension, while the radius on the carpal/metacarpal surface enables radial/ulnar deviation. The articulation of the carpal/metacarpal part against the plate also allows for rotation as well as flexion/extension. The flexible part, made from Elast-Eon, which is a silicone polyurethane elastomer, is inserted through the hole of the plate and into the holes of the radial and carpal/metacarpal parts.",0
,[Chronic hereditary nephritis with hearing loss (Alport's syndrome)].,"Two generations of one family with Alport syndrome were studied. The observation proved that women do transmit the disease, but men have signs more developed. As symptoms of the disease were pathological changes of chronic interstitial haemorrhagic pyelonephritis associated with bilateral hearing loss of cochlear type. In patients with pronounced hearing impairment (in the spiral organ) the kidney pathology was not advanced and the course of the illness rather mild. We believe that patients with kidney pathology should have their hearing examined as routine proceeding because hearing impairment is frequently associated with kidney pathology as in Alport's syndrome and other diseases. This coincidence may help in diagnosis, choice of treatment and prognostic evaluation.",0

In this study, the effects of removal of Cardinium infection on development, survival, and reproduction of Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) were investigated in the laboratory. The Cardinium-free strain was obtained by the removal of Cardinium infection by using 1% rifampicin treatment on the Cardinium-infected strain (control) for 4 wk, and no Cardinium gene product was detected in this strain throughout the experiment. The results showed that the removal of Cardinium infection had negative effects on fitness of L. bostrychophila. Compared with the control strain, the Cardinium-free strain (both in first [F1] and second [F2] generation) had a similar developmental time, reduced survivorship of immature stages, as well as reduced fecundity, which resulted in much smaller r(m) values. Using r(m) values, the fitness for Cardinium-free F1 and F2 relative to the control was calculated as 0.81 and 0.74, respectively. We concluded that the use of antibiotics combined with heat treatment might be a good control measure for L. bostrychophila.",1

In particular, we analyze the elastic modes as a function of the intensity of the applied field and for several particle concentrations. We observe that the clusters formed in these systems have multifractal characteristics, which are the result of three well defined stages of the aggregation process. In these stages three generations of clusters are produced sequentially. The structure of the suspension can be well characterized by its mass fractal dimensions and the mass radial distribution. The size distribution of the second-generation clusters written in terms of their mass fractal dimension allows us to calculate the sound speed of the longitudinal modes in the large wavelength regime. This multifractal analysis applied to several kinds of aggregates reveals that the occurrence of at least three stages of aggregation is a common feature to several physical aggregation processes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051816,Trans-Generational Effect of Maternal Lactation during Pregnancy: A Holstein Cow Model,"Epigenetic regulation in mammals begins in the first stages of embryogenesis. This prenatal programming determines, in part, phenotype expression in adult life. Some species, particularly dairy cattle, are conceived during the maternal lactation, which is a period of large energy and nutrient needs. Under these circumstances, embryo and fetal development compete for nutrients with the mammary gland, which may affect prenatal programming and predetermine phenotype at adulthood. Data from a specialized dairy breed were used to determine the transgenerational effect when embryo development coincides with maternal lactation. Longitudinal phenotypic data for milk yield (kg), ratio of fat-protein content in milk during first lactation, and lifespan (d) from 40,065 cows were adjusted for environmental and genetic effects using a Bayesian framework. Then, the effect of different maternal circumstances was determined on the residuals. The maternal-related circumstances were 1) presence of lactation, 2) maternal milk yield level, and 3) occurrence of mastitis during embryogenesis. Females born to mothers that were lactating while pregnant produced 52 kg (MonteCarlo standard error; MCs.e. = 0.009) less milk, lived 16 d (MCs.e. = 0.002) shorter and were metabolically less efficient (+0.42% milk fat/protein ratio; MCs.e.<0.001) than females whose fetal life developed in the absence of maternal lactation. The greater the maternal milk yield during embryogenesis, the larger the negative effects of prenatal programming, precluding the offspring born to the most productive cows to fully express their potential additive genetic merit during their adult life. Our data provide substantial evidence of transgenerational effect when pregnancy and lactation coincide. Although this effect is relatively low, it should not be ignored when formulating rations for lactating and pregnant cows. Furthermore, breeding, replacement, and management strategies should also take into account whether the individuals were conceived during maternal lactation because, otherwise, their performance may deviate from what it could be expected.",0

One hundred and fifty-two liver transplantations in 142 adult subjects, comprising 80 male patients and 62 female patients, were studied. After surgery, liver circulation was routinely assessed by conventional Doppler ultrasound (US). Wherever the examiners were not confident about the state of the circulation, CEUS was performed with one or more doses of a sulfur hexafluoride (SF-6)-containing second-generation contrast agent intravenously. Clinical follow up including repeat Doppler US, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the liver vasculature were used as reference standards. During the first month after transplantation, Doppler US was inconclusive with regard to patency of the hepatic artery (HA) circulation in 20 (13 %) of 152 transplantations. CEUS was performed in these patients, and detected six cases of HA thrombosis (HAT) in five transplants. CEUS correctly ruled out HA occlusion in 15 transplants. All HA occlusions occurred during the first 14 days after transplantation. In the subset of transplantations examined with CEUS, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CEUS were 100%. In approximately 13% of cases, conventional Doppler US did not provide sufficient visualization of the HA after liver transplantation. In these cases, correct diagnosis was achieved by supplementary CEUS.",0
,Safety of heavy metals as nutritional markers.,"The nutritional safety of La, Sm, Eu, Tb, Dy, Tm, Yb, Sc and Cr oxides and barium sulfate were studied in two species. The mouse study was conducted for three generations, including reproduction. During the three generations the mice were apparently not effected by quantities of metals in the feed which were 1000 times the anticipated levels. This level of metals did not exhibit any effect on the reproduction or growth of the mice through three generations. It is concluded that the metals used in the diet of the mouse at any of the use levels could be used in diets for nutritional markers. The monkey study, in which 10 times the anticipated use level of heavy metal markers were fed, further illustrates the nutritional safety of the metals studied. The tissues analyzed generally illustrated that the metals were not detectable. The balance study indicated that all the metals could be accounted for and that there is no apparent absorption of these metals.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/s1054-3589(08)61001-7,Role of Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Therapy in Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Liver Diseases,"Alcohol-induced oxidative stress is most severe in the liver because it is linked to the metabolism of ethanol, which occurs predominantly in that organ. The chapter discusses the metabolism of ethanol, alcohol dehydrogenase pathway, characterization of the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOs) and its role in ethanol metabolism, increased xenobiotic and retinoid toxicity, carcinogenicity, and oxidative stress in alcoholics and the role of catalase. The hepatocyte contains three main pathways for ethanol metabolism, each located in a different subcellular compartment—the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway of the soluble fraction of the cell, the MEOs located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and catalase located in the peroxisomes. Each of these pathways produces a specific metabolic and toxic disturbance resulting in the production of acetaldehyde, a highly reactive metabolite. Normally, fatty acids are reduced via β-oxidation in the citric acid cycle of the mitochondria, which serves as a “hydrogen donor” for the mitochondrial electron transport chain. When ethanol is reduced, the generated hydrogen equivalents, which are shuttled into the mitochondria, supplant the citric acid cycle as source and the mitochondria are shifted to a more reduced redox state. The altered redox state is responsible for the increased lactate/pyruvate ratio that results in hyperlactacidemia because of both decreased utilization and enhanced production of lactate by the liver. Hyperlactacidemia contributes to the acidosis and also reduces the capacity of the kidney to excrete uric acid, leading to secondary hyperuricemia. Other metabolic consequences include enhanced lipogenesis, depressed lipid oxidation, and hypoglycemia. The chapter discusses the characterization of the MEOs and their role in ethanol metabolism and the increased xenobiotic and retinoid toxicity, carcinogenicity, and oxidative stress in alcoholics. There is discussion on acetaldehyde: its metabolism and toxicity, including peroxidation. The chapter discusses antioxidant therapy—carotenoids, methionine and S-adenosylmethionine, vitamin E and miscellaneous antioxidants, polyenyl- and dilinoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine.",0

https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddl200,How lifetimes shape epigenotype within and across generations,"Despite our detailed characterization of the human genome at the level of the primary DNA sequence, we are still far from understanding the molecular events underlying phenotypic variation. Epigenetic modifications to the DNA sequence and associated chromatin are known to regulate gene expression and, as such, are a significant contributor to phenotype. Studies of inbred mice and monozygotic twins show that variation in the epigenotype can be seen even between genetically identical individuals and that this, in some cases at least, is associated with phenotypic differences. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the epigenome can be influenced by the environment and these changes can last a lifetime. However, we also know that epigenetic states in real-time are in continual flux and, as a result, the epigenome exhibits instability both within and across generations. We still do not understand the rules governing the establishment and maintenance of the epigenotype at any particular locus. The underlying DNA sequence itself and the sequence at unlinked loci (modifier loci) are certainly involved. Recent support for the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals suggests that the epigenetic state of the locus in the previous generation may also play a role. Over the next decade, many of these processes will be better understood, heralding a greater capacity for us to correlate measurable molecular marks with phenotype and providing the opportunity for improved diagnosis and presymptomatic healthcare.",1
,Curbing child marriages.,"Demographers are interested in marriage age because women who marry early are exposed to conceptions through the most fecund years of their lives. Women who marry young are exposed comparatively to a longer duration and tend to shorten the intergenerational years, consequently influencing the fertility to be higher. In India, despite the law, child marriages occur in many states, more prevalent among the backward conservative communities. According to India's Child Marriage Restraint Act, a woman must be 18 to marry (a man 21), but in fact in 1981 the marriage age of females was 15. This young marriage age is substantiated by available survey and report data. For example, in a mass marriage solemnized at Wardha village in Vidisha district in 1981, there was not 1 of the 110 couples of the prescribed marriage age. 55 of the brides were below age 10 and 48 were between 10-12 years. Only 8 brides were older than 14 years. A survey conducted by the Population Research Center, Lucknow University, revealed that more than half of the females surveyed were married before age 15. The census data for 1981 provide the following information: 1.19 million or 2.63% of the total 45.18 million boys aged 10-14 years and 2.67 million or 6.59% of the total 40.49 million girls were married. Christians had the highest mean age at marriage followed by Sikhs and Jains, but all religious groups had shown an improvement in their age at marriage. Several factors are responsible for child marriage. Consequently, a multidimensional approach to dealing with the problem is needed. The way to bring about this change is through creating more job and educational opportunities for women.",0

E. coli was the most common isolated pathogen (74.36%) followed by K.pneumoniae (12.82%), E. faecalis (5%) and P. mirabilis (5%). Most gramnegative pathogens were susceptible to amikacin and third generation cephalosporins. The susceptibility of these organisms to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin were in the range of 34.6-60.0%, 44.0-50.0% and 25.9-50.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Urinary tract infections were commonly observed among spinal cord injured patients in the presented institution. E. coli was the most common isolated pathogen. Surprisingly, most gram-negative pathogens were resistant to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin. An antibiotic of choice for UTI in our patients should be aminoglycoside or third generation cephalosporins. Keywords: Spinal cord injury, Urinary tract infection, Intermittent catheterization",0

The current study was designed to determine if a ""pesticide mixture"" (pesticide permethrin and insect repellent N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, DEET) promotes epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and associated DNA methylation epimutations in sperm. Gestating F0 generation female rats were exposed during fetal gonadal sex determination and the incidence of disease evaluated in F1 and F3 generations. There were significant increases in the incidence of total diseases in animals from pesticide lineage F1 and F3 generation animals. Pubertal abnormalities, testis disease, and ovarian disease (primordial follicle loss and polycystic ovarian disease) were increased in F3 generation animals. Analysis of the pesticide lineage F3 generation sperm epigenome identified 363 differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) termed epimutations. Observations demonstrate that a pesticide mixture (permethrin and DEET) can promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease and potential sperm epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral environmental exposures.",1
